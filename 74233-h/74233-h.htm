<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The fragment of a novel, written by Jane Austen in the first three
months of the year in which she died, has no name; but it has long
been known to members of her family as <cite>Sanditon</cite>.</p>

<p>The manuscript passed into the possession of Jane Austen’s
niece Anna (Mrs. Ben Lefroy); and it was known to Mrs. Lefroy’s
half-brother, James Edward Austen-Leigh, the author of the <cite>Memoir
of Jane Austen</cite> first published in 1870. In the second edition
(1871) Mr. Austen-Leigh added the cancelled chapter of <cite>Persuasion</cite>,
the fragment called <cite>The Watsons</cite>, and <cite>Lady Susan</cite>, and in his
concluding chapter gave an account of ‘The Last Work’.</p>

<div class="blockquot0">

<p>Such an unfinished fragment cannot be presented to the public;
but I am persuaded that some of Jane Austen’s admirers will be
glad to learn something about the latest creations which were
forming themselves in her mind; and therefore, as some of the
principal characters were already sketched in with a vigorous
hand, I will try to give an idea of them, illustrated by extracts
from the work.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the account which follows, the fragment is described in some
detail; the <i lang="la">verbatim</i> quotations amount to perhaps twenty pages of
this edition. The present owner<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the manuscript has reached
the conclusion that, since so much has long been before the public,
it is right that the whole should no longer be withheld.</p>

<div class="footnote"><br>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1 </a> A grand-daughter of Anna Lefroy.</p>

</div>

<p>Some explanation may be thought necessary of the way in which the
fragment is printed. It approximates to the manner of 1817, and
the result is somewhat less in bulk than one of the three volumes
in which Mr. Egerton or Mr. Murray would doubtless have issued the
work if it had been completed for publication. The printer, however,
would have made certain departures from his copy: he would have
expanded the contractions; he would have broken up the chapters
into paragraphs; and he would, in a greater or less degree, have
regularized the spelling and the punctuation. It has seemed best not
to do this in 1925, but to print the author’s manuscript as nearly
as possible in the last form it attained. It may be thought pedantic
to reproduce irregularities which the author would not have wished
to retain; but it seemed more important to avoid another danger.
To have smoothed out the manuscript into a specious semblance of
finality would have been to prejudice, in some degree, the question
how far it did, in fact, represent the author’s final intention.
This edition, printed as it is, is open to no such objection. It
is, for critical purposes, virtually a facsimile of all that Miss
Austen wrote and did not erase.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the textual notes, printed at the end of the
volume, that the manuscript contains a very large number of erasures
and interlineations. It is so neat, and so uniformly spaced, that
it is almost everywhere possible to distinguish what was first
written from what was added, or substituted, between the lines. These
corrections are not such as could have resulted from subsequent
revision of a fair copy previously made. In very many places the
author has changed her mind <i lang="la" title="without deliberation">currente calamo</i>; has begun a sentence
in one form and finished it in another. The number and nature of
such changes create a presumption, at least, that we are dealing
with a first draft.</p>

<p class="sp2">The manuscript consists of three quires. The first and second, which
are sewn together, are of 16 and 24 leaves respectively, measuring
7½ in. × 4¹¹⁄₁₆ in. The watermark, which occurs several times in
both quires, is <span class="smcap">Kent 1812</span>.</p>

<p>The first quire contains Chapters 1&ndash;3. The third chapter appears to
end, on f. 16<sup>v</sup>, with an incomplete sentence; but the concluding
words, <a href="#Preface_1"><i>that Loveliness was complete</i></a>, were written at the foot of
f. 1<sup>r</sup>. The second quire contains Chapters 4&ndash;8 and part of Chapter
9.</p>

<p>The third quire (marked 2 on the first page) is of 40 leaves, 6⅜
in. × 4 in. It bears a large ornamental watermark, and also the
name <span class="smcap">Joseph Coles</span> and the date 1815. Folios 21&ndash;40, <abbr title="that is">i. e.</abbr> the latter
half of the quire, are blank; a fact which suggests that no part
of the manuscript is lost. This quire contains the remainder of
Chapter 9 (beginning with the words <a href="#Preface_2"><i>with a thousand regrets</i></a>&mdash;p.
117 of this edition) and Chapters 10&ndash;12.</p>

<p>The dates added by Miss Austen are:</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>(1) at the top of the first page of the first quire, <i>Jan: 27.&ndash;1817</i></p>

<p>(2) at the top of the first page of the third quire, <i>March 1<sup>st</sup></i></p>

<p>(3) at the end of the last sentence (the last page of the third
quire), <i>March 18</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Part of the second quire was originally written in pencil, and
afterwards inked over. The passage so written is that printed on
pp. 99&ndash;101 of this edition (from <a href="#Preface_3"><i>cried Lady <span class="nowrap">D&mdash;</span></i></a> to <a href="#Preface_4"><i>so seriously
that Charlotte</i></a>). The author of the <cite>Memoir</cite> writes, on this point:</p>

<div class="blockquot0">

<p>The chief part of this manuscript is written in her usual firm
and neat hand, but some of the latter pages seem to have been
first traced in pencil, probably when she was too weak to sit
long at her desk, and written over in ink afterwards.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the manuscript as such does not bear out this implication of
a progressive decline. The place at which pencil was used is in
fact not much later than the middle; and the latter part of the
manuscript shows no change in legibility or in accuracy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">A Gentleman &amp; Lady travelling from
Tunbridge towards that part of the
Sussex Coast which lies between Hastings
&amp; E. Bourne, <a href="#n1_4" id="p1_4">being induced by
Business to quit the high road, &amp;
attempt a very rough Lane, were overturned</a>
in toiling up it’s long ascent
<a href="#n1_8" id="p1_8">half rock, half sand</a>.&mdash;The accident
happened just beyond the only Gentleman’s
House near the Lane&mdash;<a href="#n1_10" id="p1_10">a House</a>,
which their Driver on being <a href="#n1_11" id="p1_11">first required
to take that direction</a>, had conceived
to be necessarily their object,
&amp; had with most unwilling Looks been
constrained <a href="#n1_15a" id="p1_15a">to pass by</a>&mdash;. <a href="#n1_15b" id="p1_15b">He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>
grumbled &amp; shaken his shoulders so
much indeed, and pitied &amp; cut his
Horses so sharply</a>, that he might have
been open to the suspicion of overturning
them on purpose (especially as
the Carriage was <a href="#n2_6" id="p2_6">not his Masters</a> own)
if the road <a href="#n2_7a" id="p2_7a">had</a> not <a href="#n2_7b" id="p2_7b">indisputably become
considerably worse</a> than before,
as soon as the premises of the said
House were <a href="#n2_10a" id="p2_10a">left behind</a>&mdash;<a href="#n2_10b" id="p2_10b">expressing
with a most intelligent portentous
countenance</a> that beyond it no wheels
but cart wheels <a href="#n2_13" id="p2_13">could safely proceed</a>.
The severity of the fall was broken by
their slow pace &amp; the narrowness of
the Lane, &amp; the <a href="#n2_16" id="p2_16">Gentleman</a> having
scrambled out &amp; helped out his companion,
they neither of them <a href="#n2_18" id="p2_18">at first</a>
felt more than shaken &amp; bruised. But
the Gentleman had in the course of the
extrication sprained his foot&mdash;&amp; <a href="#n2_21" id="p2_21">soon</a>
becoming sensible of it, was obliged <a href="#n2_22" id="p2_22">in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>
a few moments</a> to cut short, both his
remonstrance to the Driver &amp; his <a href="#n3_2a" id="p3_2a">congratulations</a>
<a href="#n3_2b" id="p3_2b">to his wife &amp; himself</a>&mdash;&amp;
sit down on the bank, unable to stand.&mdash;“There
is something wrong here,
said he&mdash;putting his hand to his ancle&mdash;But
never mind, my Dear&mdash;(looking up
at her with a smile)&mdash;It c<sup>d</sup> not have
happened, you know, in a better place.&mdash;Good
out of Evil&mdash;. The very thing
perhaps to be wished for. We shall
soon get releif.&mdash; <em>There</em>, I fancy lies
my cure”&mdash;pointing to <a href="#n3_13" id="p3_13">the neat-looking</a>
end of a <a href="#n3_14" id="p3_14">Cottage</a>, which was seen
<a href="#n3_15a" id="p3_15a">romantically</a> situated <a href="#n3_15b" id="p3_15b">among wood</a> on
a high Eminence at some little Distance&mdash;“Does
not <em>that</em> promise to be
the very place?”&mdash;His wife fervently
hoped it was&mdash;but stood, terrified &amp;
anxious, <a href="#n3_20" id="p3_20">neither</a> able to do or suggest
anything&mdash;&amp; receiving her first real
comfort from the sight of several persons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>now <a href="#n4_1" id="p4_1">coming</a> to their assistance.
The accident <a href="#n4_2" id="p4_2">had</a> been discerned from
a Hayfield adjoining the House they
had passed&mdash;&amp; the persons who approached,
were a well-looking Hale,
Gentlemanlike Man, of middle age, the
Proprietor of the Place, who happened
to be among his Haymakers at the
time, &amp; three or four of the ablest of
them summoned to attend their Master&mdash;to
say nothing of all the rest of the
field, Men, Women &amp; Children&mdash;not
very far off.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> Heywood, such was
the name of the said Proprietor, advanced
with a very civil <a href="#n4_15" id="p4_15">salutation</a>&mdash;much
concern for the accident&mdash;some
surprise at any body’s attempting that
road in a Carriage&mdash;&amp; ready offers of
<a href="#n4_19" id="p4_19">assistance</a>. His courtesies were received
with Goodbreeding &amp; gratitude &amp; while
<a href="#n4_21" id="p4_21">one or two</a> of the Men lent their help
to the Driver in getting the Carriage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span>upright again, the Travellor said&mdash;“You
are extremely obliging Sir, &amp;
I take you at your word.&mdash;The injury
to my Leg is I dare say very trifling,
but it is always <a href="#n5_5" id="p5_5">best</a> in these cases to
have a surgeon’s opinion without loss
of time; and as the road does not seem
at present in <a href="#n5_8" id="p5_8">a favourable</a> state for
my getting up to his house myself, I will
thank you to send off one of these good
People for the Surgeon.” “The Surgeon
Sir!&mdash;replied M<sup>r</sup> Heywood&mdash;I am
afraid you will find no surgeon at hand
here, but I dare say we shall do very
well without <a href="#n5_15a" id="p5_15a">him</a>.”&mdash;“Nay Sir, <a href="#n5_15b" id="p5_15b">if <em>he</em></a> is
not in the way, his Partner will do
just as well&mdash;or <a href="#n5_17a" id="p5_17a">rather</a> better&mdash;. I w<sup>d</sup>
rather see his Partner indeed&mdash;I <a href="#n5_17b" id="p5_17b">would
prefer the attendance of his Partner</a>.&mdash;One
of these good people <a href="#n5_20" id="p5_20">can be with
him</a> in three minutes I am sure. I need
not ask whether I see the House;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span>(looking towards the Cottage) <a href="#n6_1" id="p6_1">for excepting</a>
your own, we have passed none
in this place, which can be the abode
of a Gentleman.”&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> H. looked very
much astonished&mdash;&amp; replied&mdash;“What
Sir! are you expecting to find a Surgeon
in that Cottage?&mdash;We have neither
Surgeon nor Partner in the Parish I
assure you.”&mdash;“Excuse me Sir&mdash;replied
the other. I am sorry to have the
appearance of contradicting you&mdash;but
<a href="#n6_12" id="p6_12">though</a> from the extent of the Parish
or some other cause you may not be
aware of the fact;&mdash;<a href="#n6_14" id="p6_14">stay</a>&mdash;Can I be
mistaken in the place?&mdash;Am I not in
Willingden?&mdash;Is not this Willingden?”
“Yes Sir, this is certainly Willingden.”
“Then Sir, I can bring proof of your
having a Surgeon in the Parish&mdash;<a href="#n6_20" id="p6_20">whether
you may know it or not</a>. Here
Sir&mdash;(taking out his Pocket book&mdash;)
if you will do me the favour of casting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span>your eye over these advertisements,
which I cut out myself from the Morning
Post &amp; the Kentish Gazette, <a href="#n7_3" id="p7_3">only
yesterday morn<sup>g</sup> in London</a>&mdash;I think
you will be convinced that I am not
speaking at random. You will find it
an advertisement Sir, of the dissolution
of <a href="#n7_8" id="p7_8">a Partnership</a> in the Medical Line&mdash;in
your own Parish&mdash;extensive Business&mdash;undeniable
Character&mdash;respectable
references&mdash;wishing to form a
separate Establishment&mdash;You will find
it at full length Sir”&mdash;offering him the
two little oblong extracts.&mdash;“Sir&mdash;said
M<sup>r</sup> Heywood <a href="#n7_15" id="p7_15">with a good humoured
smile</a>&mdash;if you were to shew me all the
Newspapers that are printed in one
week throughout the Kingdom, you
w<sup>d</sup> not persuade me of there being a
Surgeon in <a href="#n7_20a" id="p7_20a">Willingden</a>,&mdash;<a href="#n7_20b" id="p7_20b">for having</a>
<a href="#n7_21" id="p7_21">lived here</a> ever since I was born,
<a href="#n7_22a" id="p7_22a">Man &amp; Boy</a> 57 years, <a href="#n7_22b" id="p7_22b">I think I must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span>have <em>known</em> of such a person, at least
I may venture</a> to say that he has not
<em>much Business</em>&mdash;<a href="#n8_3" id="p8_3">To be sure</a>, if Gentlemen
were to be often attempting this
Lane in Post-chaises, it might not be
a bad speculation for a Surgeon to get
a House at the top of the Hill.&mdash;But
as to that Cottage, I can assure you
<a href="#n8_9" id="p8_9">Sir</a> that it is in fact&mdash;(in spite of its
spruce air at this <span class="nowrap">distance&mdash;)</span> as indifferent
a double Tenement as any in
the Parish, <a href="#n8_12" id="p8_12">and that my Shepherd</a> lives
at one end, &amp; three old women at the
other.” He took the <a href="#n8_14" id="p8_14">peices</a> of paper
as he spoke&mdash;&amp; having looked them
over, added&mdash;“I beleive I can explain
it Sir.&mdash;Your mistake is in the place.&mdash;There
are two Willingdens in this
Country&mdash;&amp; your advertisements refer
to the other&mdash;which is Great Willingden,
or Willingden Abbots, &amp; lies 7
miles off, on the other side of Battel&mdash;quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span>
down in the Weald. And <em>we</em>
Sir&mdash;(speaking rather proudly) are not
in the Weald.”&mdash;“Not <em>down</em> in the
Weald I am sure Sir, replied the
Traveller, pleasantly. It took us half
an hour to climb your Hill.&mdash;Well Sir&mdash;I
dare say it is as you say, &amp; I have
made an abominably stupid Blunder.&mdash;All
done in a moment;&mdash;the advertisements
did not catch my eye till the <a href="#n9_10" id="p9_10">last</a>
half hour of our being in Town;&mdash;<a href="#n9_12a" id="p9_12a">when</a>
everything <a href="#n9_12b" id="p9_12b">was in the</a> hurry &amp;
confusion which always attend a short

<a href="#n9_16" id="p9_16">you know</a> till the Carriage is at
the door&mdash;<a href="#n9_17" id="p9_17">and accordingly satisfying</a>
myself with a breif enquiry, &amp; finding
we were actually to pass within a mile
or two of a <em>Willingden</em>,<a href="#n9_20" id="p9_20"> I </a>sought no
farther ... My Dear&mdash;(to his wife)
I am very sorry to have brought you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>into this <a href="#n10_1" id="p10_1">Scrape</a>. But do not be alarmed
about my Leg. It gives me no pain
while I am quiet,&mdash;and as soon as these
good people have succeeded in setting
the Car<sup>ge</sup> to rights &amp; turning the
Horses round, the best thing we can
do will be to measure back our steps
into the Turnpike road &amp; proceed to
Hailsham, &amp; so Home, without attempting
anything farther.&mdash;Two hours take
us home, from Hailsham&mdash;and when
once at home, we have our remedy at
hand <a href="#n10_13a" id="p10_13a">you know</a>.&mdash;A little of our <a href="#n10_13b" id="p10_13b">own</a>
Bracing Sea air will soon set me on
my feet again.&mdash;Depend upon it my
Dear, it is exactly a case for the Sea.
Saline <a href="#n10_17" id="p10_17">air &amp; immersion</a> will be the very
thing.&mdash;My sensations tell me so already.”&mdash;In
a most friendly manner
M<sup>r</sup> Heywood here interposed, entreating
them not to think of proceeding
till the ancle had been examined, &amp;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>some refreshment taken, &amp; very cordially
pressing them to make use of
his House for both purposes.&mdash;“We
are always well stocked, said he, with
all the common remedies for Sprains
&amp; Bruises&mdash;&amp; I will answer for the
pleasure it will give my Wife &amp; daughters
to be of <a href="#n11_8" id="p11_8">service to you &amp; this
Lady</a> in every way in their power.”&mdash;A
twinge or two, in trying to move his
foot disposed the Travellor to think
rather more as he had done at first of
the benefit of immediate assistance&mdash;&amp;
consulting his wife in the few words
of “Well my Dear, I beleive <a href="#n11_15" id="p11_15">it will be
better for us</a>.”&mdash;<a href="#n11_16" id="p11_16">turned</a> again to M<sup>r</sup>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>name is Parker.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> Parker of Sanditon;&mdash;this
Lady, my wife M<sup>rs</sup> Parker.&mdash;We

am by no means the first of <a href="#n12_5" id="p12_5">my</a> Family,
holding Landed Property in the Parish
of Sanditon, may be unknown at this
distance from the Coast&mdash;but Sanditon
<a href="#n12_9" id="p12_9">itself</a>&mdash;everybody has heard of Sanditon,&mdash;the
favourite&mdash;for a young &amp;
rising Bathing-place, certainly the
<a href="#n12_11" id="p12_11">favourite spot</a> of all that are to be
found along the <a href="#n12_13" id="p12_13">coast</a> of Sussex;&mdash;the
most favoured by Nature, &amp; <a href="#n12_14" id="p12_14">promising
to be the most chosen</a> by Man.”&mdash;“Yes&mdash;I
have heard of Sanditon. replied
M<sup>r</sup> H.&mdash;Every five years, one
hears of some new place or other
starting up by the Sea, &amp; growing the
fashion.&mdash;How they can half of them
be filled, is <a href="#n12_21" id="p12_21">the wonder!</a> <em>Where</em> People
can be found with Money <a href="#n12_22" id="p12_22">or Time</a> to

I dare say you find</a>, Sir.” “Not at
all Sir, not at all&mdash;cried M<sup>r</sup> Parker
eagerly. Quite the contrary I assure
you.&mdash;A common idea&mdash;but a mistaken
one. It may apply to your
large, overgrown Places, like Brighton,
or Worthing, or East Bourne&mdash;but <em>not</em>
to a small village like Sanditon, precluded
by its size from <a href="#n13_12" id="p13_12">experiencing</a>
any of the evils of Civilization, while
the growth of the place, the Buildings,
the <a href="#n13_15" id="p13_15">Nursery Grounds</a>, the demand for
every thing, &amp; the sure resort of the
very best Company, <a href="#n13_17" id="p13_17">those regular</a>,
steady, private Families of thorough
Gentility &amp; Character, <a href="#n13_19" id="p13_19">who are a blessing
everywhere, excite</a> the industry of
the Poor <a href="#n13_21" id="p13_21">and diffuse</a> comfort &amp; improvement
among them of every <a href="#n13_22" id="p13_22">sort</a>.&mdash;No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span>
Sir, I assure you, Sanditon is not
a <a href="#n14_3" id="p14_3">place</a>&mdash;&mdash;” “I do not mean to take
exceptions to <em>any</em> place in particular
Sir, answered M<sup>r</sup> H.&mdash;I only think our
Coast is too full of them altogether&mdash;But
had we not better try to get you”&mdash;&mdash;“Our
Coast too full”&mdash;repeated
M<sup>r</sup> P.&mdash;On that point perhaps we
may not <a href="#n14_9" id="p14_9">totally</a> disagree;&mdash;at least
there are <em>enough</em>. Our Coast is abundant
enough; it demands no more.&mdash;Every
body’s Taste &amp; every body’s
finances may be suited&mdash;And those
good people who are trying to add
to the number, are in my opinion
excessively absurd, &amp; <a href="#n14_16" id="p14_16">must soon find
themselves</a> the Dupes of their own
fallacious Calculations.&mdash;Such a place
as Sanditon Sir, I may say was
wanted, was called for.&mdash;Nature had
marked it out&mdash;had spoken in most
intelligible Characters&mdash;The finest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>purest Sea Breeze on the Coast&mdash;acknowledged
to be so&mdash;Excellent
Bathing&mdash;fine hard sand&mdash;Deep Water
10 yards from the Shore&mdash;no Mud&mdash;no
Weeds&mdash;no shiney rocks&mdash;Never
was there a place more palpably designed
by Nature for the resort of the
Invalid&mdash;the very Spot which Thousands
seemed in need of.&mdash;The most
desirable distance from London! <a href="#n15_10" id="p15_10">One
complete, measured</a> mile nearer than
East Bourne. Only conceive Sir, the
advantage of <a href="#n15_13" id="p15_13">saving a whole Mile</a>, in
a long Journey. But Brinshore Sir,
which I dare say you have in your
eye&mdash;the attempts of two or three
speculating People about Brinshore,
this last Year, to raise that paltry
Hamlet, <a href="#n15_19" id="p15_19">lying, as it does</a> between
a stagnant marsh, <a href="#n15_20" id="p15_20">a bleak Moor</a> &amp;
the constant effluvia of a ridge
of putrifying sea weed, can end in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span>nothing but their own Disappointment.
What in the name of Common
Sense is to <em>recommend</em> Brinshore?&mdash;A
most insalubrious Air&mdash;Roads proverbially
detestable&mdash;Water Brackish
beyond example, impossible to get a
good dish of Tea within 3 miles of the
place&mdash;&amp; as for the Soil&mdash;it is so cold &amp;
ungrateful that it can hardly be made
to <a href="#n16_10" id="p16_10">yeild</a> a Cabbage.&mdash;Depend upon it
Sir, that this is a faithful Description
of Brinshore&mdash;not in the smallest degree
exaggerated&mdash;&amp; if you have heard it
differently spoken of&mdash;&mdash;” “Sir, I
never heard it spoken of in my Life
before, said M<sup>r</sup> Heywood. I did not
know there was such a place in the
World.”&mdash;“You did not!&mdash;There my
Dear&mdash;(turning with exultation to his
Wife)&mdash;you see how it is. So much
for the Celebrity of Brinshore!&mdash;This
Gentleman did not know there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span>such a place in the World.&mdash;<a href="#n17_1" id="p17_1">Why, in
truth Sir, I fancy</a> we may apply to
Brinshore, <a href="#n17_3" id="p17_3">that line</a> of the Poet Cowper
in his description of the religious Cottager,
as opposed to Voltaire&mdash;“<em>She</em>,
never heard of half a mile from home.”&mdash;“With
all my Heart Sir&mdash;Apply any
Verses you like to it&mdash;But I want to
see something applied to your Leg&mdash;&amp;
I am sure by your Lady’s countenance
that she <a href="#n17_11" id="p17_11">is quite of my opinion
&amp; thinks</a> it a pity to lose any more
time&mdash;And here come my Girls to
speak for themselves &amp; their Mother.
<a href="#n17_15" id="p17_15">(two</a> or three genteel looking young

thing of this kind soon makes a Stir
in a lonely place like ours.&mdash;Now Sir,
let us see how you can be best conveyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>into the House.”&mdash;The young
Ladies approached &amp; said <a href="#n18_2" id="p18_2">every thing
that was proper</a> to <a href="#n18_3" id="p18_3">recommend</a> their
Father’s offers; &amp; in an unaffected
manner calculated to make the Strangers
easy&mdash;and as M<sup>rs</sup> <span class="nowrap">P&mdash;</span> was
exceedingly anxious for relief&mdash;and
her Husband by this time, not much
less disposed for it&mdash;a very few civil
scruples were enough&mdash;especially as <a href="#n18_10" id="p18_10">the
Carriage being now set up, was discovered
to have received such Injury</a>
on the fallen side as to be unfit for

carried into the House, and his Carriage

<p class="firstpara">The acquaintance, thus oddly begun,
was neither short nor unimportant.
<a href="#n19_3" id="p19_3">For a whole fortnight the Travellors
were fixed at Willingden</a>; <a href="#n19_4" id="p19_4">Mr. P.’s
sprain proving</a> too serious for him to
move sooner.&mdash;He had fallen into very
good hands. The Heywoods were a
thoroughly respectable family, &amp; every
possible attention was paid in the
kindest &amp; most unpretending manner,
to both Husband &amp; wife. <em>He</em> was
waited on &amp; nursed, &amp; <em>she</em> cheered &amp;
comforted with <a href="#n19_13" id="p19_13">unremitting</a> kindness&mdash;and
as every <a href="#n19_14" id="p19_14">office</a> of Hospitality &amp;
friendliness was received as it ought&mdash;as
there was not more good will on one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>side than Gratitude on the other&mdash;nor
any deficiency of generally pleasant
manners <a href="#n20_3" id="p20_3">on either</a>, they grew to like
each other in the course of that fortnight,
exceedingly well.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> Parker’s
Character &amp; History were soon <a href="#n20_6" id="p20_6">unfolded</a>.
All that he understood of himself,
he readily told, <a href="#n20_8" id="p20_8">for he was</a> very
openhearted;&mdash;&amp; where he might be
himself in the dark, <a href="#n20_10" id="p20_10">his conversation</a>
was still giving <a href="#n20_11" id="p20_11">information</a>, to such of
the Heywoods as could observe.&mdash;By
such he was perceived to be an Enthusiast;&mdash;<a href="#n20_14" id="p20_14">on</a>
the subject of Sanditon,
a complete Enthusiast.&mdash;Sanditon,&mdash;the
success of Sanditon as a small,
fashionable Bathing Place was the
object, for which he seemed to live.
A very few years ago, &amp; it had been
a <a href="#n20_20a" id="p20_20a">quiet</a> <a href="#n20_20b" id="p20_20b">Village</a> of no <a href="#n20_20c" id="p20_20c">pretensions</a>; but
some natural advantages in its position
&amp; <a href="#n20_22" id="p20_22">some</a> accidental circumstances having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>suggested to himself, &amp; the other
principal <a href="#n21_2" id="p21_2">Land Holder</a>, the probability
of it’s <a href="#n21_3" id="p21_3">becoming</a> a profitable Speculation,
they had engaged in it, &amp; planned
&amp; built, &amp; praised &amp; puffed, &amp; raised
it to a something of <a href="#n21_6a" id="p21_6a">young</a> <a href="#n21_6b" id="p21_6b">Renown</a>&mdash;and
M<sup>r</sup>. Parker could now think of very
little besides.&mdash;The Facts, which in
more direct communication, he laid
before them were that he was about
5 &amp; 30&mdash;had been married,&mdash;very
happily married 7 years&mdash;&amp; had 4 sweet
Children at home;&mdash;that he was <a href="#n21_13" id="p21_13">of
a respectable</a> Family, &amp; easy though
not large fortune;&mdash;no Profession&mdash;succeeding
as eldest son to the Property
which 2 or 3 Generations had
been holding &amp; accumulating before
him;&mdash;that he had 2 Brothers &amp; 2
Sisters&mdash;all single &amp; all independant&mdash;the
eldest of the two <a href="#n21_21" id="p21_21">former indeed</a>, by
collateral Inheritance, quite as well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span>provided for as himself.&mdash;His object in
quitting the high road, to hunt for an
advertising Surgeon, was also plainly
stated;&mdash;it had not proceeded from
any intention of spraining <a href="#n22_5" id="p22_5">his ancle</a>
or doing himself any other Injury
for the good of such Surgeon&mdash;nor (as
M<sup>r</sup> H. had been apt to suppose) from
any design of entering into Partnership
with him&mdash;; it was merely in consequence
of a wish to establish some
medical Man at Sanditon, which the
nature of the Advertisement induced
him to expect to accomplish in Willingden.&mdash;He
was convinced that the advantage
of a medical Man at hand w<sup>d</sup>
very materially promote the rise &amp;
prosperity of the Place&mdash;w<sup>d</sup> in fact
tend to bring a <a href="#n22_19" id="p22_19">prodigious</a> influx;&mdash;nothing
else was wanting. He had
<em>strong</em> reason to beleive that <em>one</em> family
had been deterred <a href="#n22_22" id="p22_22">last year</a> from trying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span>Sanditon on that account&mdash;&amp; probably
very many more&mdash;and his own Sisters
who were sad Invalids, &amp; whom he was
very anxious to get to Sanditon this
Summer, could hardly be expected to
hazard themselves in a place where
they could not have immediate medical
advice.&mdash;Upon the whole, M<sup>r</sup> P. was
evidently an amiable, family-man, fond
of Wife, Child<sup>n</sup>, Brothers &amp; Sisters&mdash;&amp;
generally kind-hearted;&mdash;Liberal,
gentlemanlike, easy to please;&mdash;of a
sanguine turn of mind, with more
Imagination than Judgement. And
M<sup>rs</sup> P. was as evidently a gentle,
amiable, sweet tempered Woman, the
properest wife in the World for a Man
of strong Understanding, but not of
capacity to supply the cooler reflection
which her own Husband sometimes
needed, &amp; so entirely waiting to be
guided on every occasion, that whether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span>he were risking his Fortune or spraining
his Ancle, she <a href="#n24_2" id="p24_2">remained</a> equally useless.&mdash;Sanditon
was a second Wife &amp;
4 Children to him&mdash;hardly less Dear&mdash;&amp;
certainly more engrossing.&mdash;He could
talk of it for ever.&mdash;It had indeed the
highest claims;&mdash;<a href="#n24_7" id="p24_7">not only those of</a>
Birthplace, Property, <a href="#n24_8" id="p24_8">and Home</a>,&mdash;it
was <a href="#n24_9" id="p24_9">his Mine</a>, his Lottery, his Speculation
&amp; his Hobby Horse; <a href="#n24_10" id="p24_10">his Occupation</a>
his Hope &amp; his Futurity.&mdash;He
was extremely desirous of drawing his
good friends at Willingden thither;
<a href="#n24_14" id="p24_14">and his endeavours</a> in the cause, were
as grateful &amp; disinterested, as they
were warm.&mdash;He wanted to secure the
promise of a visit&mdash;to get as many of
the Family as his <a href="#n24_18" id="p24_18">own house</a> w<sup>d</sup> contain,
to follow him to Sanditon as soon
as possible&mdash;and healthy as they all
undeniably were&mdash;foresaw that every
one of them w<sup>d</sup> be benefited by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span><a href="#n25_1" id="p25_1">sea</a>.&mdash;He held it indeed as certain, that
no person c<sup>d</sup> be really well, no person,
(however upheld for the present by
fortuitous aids of exercise &amp; <a href="#n25_4" id="p25_4">spirits</a> in
a semblance of Health) could be really
in a state of secure &amp; permanent Health
without spending at least 6 weeks by
the Sea every year.&mdash;The Sea air &amp; Sea
Bathing together were <a href="#n25_9a" id="p25_9a">nearly</a> <a href="#n25_9b" id="p25_9b">infallible</a>,
one or the other of them being a match
for every <a href="#n25_11" id="p25_11">Disorder</a>, of the Stomach,
the Lungs or the <a href="#n25_12a" id="p25_12a">Blood</a>; <a href="#n25_12b" id="p25_12b">They were</a>
anti-spasmodic, anti-pulmonary, anti-sceptic,
<a href="#n25_14" id="p25_14">anti-bilious</a> &amp; anti-rheumatic.
Nobody could catch cold by the Sea,
Nobody wanted appetite by the Sea,
<a href="#n25_17" id="p25_17">Nobody wanted Spirits, Nobody wanted
Strength</a>.&mdash;They were healing, softing,
relaxing&mdash;fortifying &amp; bracing&mdash;<a href="#n25_19" id="p25_19">seemingly</a>
just as <a href="#n25_20" id="p25_20">was wanted</a>&mdash;sometimes
one, sometimes the other.&mdash;If the Sea
breeze failed, the Sea-Bath was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>certain corrective;&mdash;&amp; where Bathing
disagreed, the Sea Breeze alone was
<a href="#n26_3" id="p26_3">evidently</a> designed by Nature for the
cure.&mdash;His eloquence however could
not prevail. M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> <span class="nowrap">H&mdash;</span> never
left home. Marrying early &amp; having
a very numerous Family, <a href="#n26_7" id="p26_7">their</a> movements
had been <a href="#n26_8" id="p26_8">long</a> limitted to one
small circle; &amp; they were older in
Habits than in Age.&mdash;Excepting two
Journeys to London in the year, to
receive his Dividends, M<sup>r</sup> H. went no
farther than his feet or his well-tried
old Horse <a href="#n26_14" id="p26_14">could carry</a> him, and M<sup>rs</sup>
Heywood’s Adventurings were only
now &amp; then to visit her Neighbours,
in the <a href="#n26_17" id="p26_17">old</a> Coach which had been new
when they married &amp; fresh lined on
their <a href="#n26_19" id="p26_19">eldest</a> son’s coming of age 10
years ago.&mdash;They had very pretty
Property&mdash;enough, had their family
been of reasonable Limits to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>allowed them a very gentlemanlike
share of Luxuries &amp; Change&mdash;enough
for them to have indulged in a new
Carriage &amp; better roads, <a href="#n27_4" id="p27_4">an occasional
month</a> at Tunbridge Wells, &amp; <a href="#n27_5" id="p27_5">symptoms</a>
of the Gout <a href="#n27_6" id="p27_6">and</a> a Winter at
Bath;&mdash;but the maintenance, Education
&amp; fitting out of 14 Children demanded
a very quiet, settled, careful
course of Life&mdash;&amp; <a href="#n27_10" id="p27_10">obliged</a> them to be
stationary &amp; healthy at Willingden.
What Prudence had at first enjoined,
was now rendered pleasant by Habit.
They never left home, &amp; they had
a gratification in saying so.&mdash;But very
far from wishing their Children to do
the same, they were glad to promote
<em>their</em> getting out into the World, as
much as possible. <em>They</em> staid at home,
that their Children <em>might</em> get out;&mdash;and
while making that home extremely
comfortable, welcomed every change
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>from it which could <a href="#n28_1" id="p28_1">give useful connections
or</a> respectable acquaintance
to Sons or Daughters. When M<sup>r</sup> &amp;
M<sup>rs</sup> Parker therefore ceased from soliciting
a family-visit, and bounded their
veiws to carrying back one <a href="#n28_6" id="p28_6">Daughter</a>
with them, no difficulties were started.
It was general pleasure &amp; consent.&mdash;Their
invitation was to Miss Charlotte
Heywood, a very pleasing young woman
of two and twenty, the eldest of the
Daughters at home, &amp; the one, who
<a href="#n28_13" id="p28_13">under her Mother’s directions</a> had been
particularly useful &amp; obliging to them;
<a href="#n28_15" id="p28_15">who</a> had attended them most, &amp; knew
them best.&mdash;Charlotte was to go,&mdash;with
excellent health, to bathe &amp; be
better if she could&mdash;to receive every
possible pleasure which Sanditon could
be made to supply by the <a href="#n28_20" id="p28_20">gratitude</a> of
those she went with&mdash;&amp; to buy new
Parasols, new Gloves, &amp; new Broches,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span><a href="#n29_1a" id="p29_1a">for her sisters &amp;</a> herself at the <a href="#n29_1b" id="p29_1b">Library</a>,
which M<sup>r</sup> P. was anxiously wishing to
support.&mdash;All that M<sup>r</sup> Heywood himself
could be persuaded to promise was,
that he would <a href="#n29_5a" id="p29_5a">send</a> everyone to <a href="#n29_5b" id="p29_5b">Sanditon</a>,
who asked his advice, &amp; that
nothing should ever induce him (as far
<a href="#n29_8" id="p29_8">[as]</a> the future could be answered for)

<h2>CHAPTER 3.</h2>

<p class="firstpara">Every Neighbourhood should have a
great Lady.&mdash;The great Lady of Sanditon,
was Lady Denham; &amp; in their
Journey from Willingden to the Coast,
M<sup>r</sup> Parker gave Charlotte a more
detailed account of her, than had been
called for before.&mdash;She had been necessarily
often mentioned at Willingden,&mdash;for
being his Colleague in Speculation,
Sanditon itself could not be talked of
long, without the introduction of Lady
Denham &amp; that she was a very rich old
Lady, who had buried two Husbands,
who knew the value of Money, was very
much looked up to &amp; had a poor Cousin
living with her, were <a href="#n31_16" id="p31_16">facts</a> already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>well known, but some further particulars
of <a href="#n32_2" id="p32_2">her history &amp; her Character</a>
<a href="#n32_3" id="p32_3">served</a> to lighten the tediousness of
a long <a href="#n32_4" id="p32_4">Hill</a>, or a heavy bit of road, and
to give the visiting Young Lady a suitable
Knowledge of the Person <a href="#n32_6" id="p32_6">with
whom</a> she might now expect to be
daily associating.&mdash;Lady D. had been
a rich Miss Brereton, born to Wealth
but not to Education. Her first Husband
had been a M<sup>r</sup> Hollis, a man of
considerable Property in the Country,
of which a large share of the Parish of
Sanditon, with Manor &amp; Mansion House
made a part. He had been <a href="#n32_15" id="p32_15">an elderly</a>
Man when she married him;&mdash;her own
age about 30.&mdash;Her motives for such
a Match could be little understood at
the distance of 40 years, but she had so
well nursed &amp; pleased M<sup>r</sup> Hollis, that
at his death he left her everything&mdash;all
his Estates, &amp; all at her Disposal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>After a widowhood of some years, she
had been induced to marry again.
The late Sir Harry Denham, of Denham
Park in the Neighbourhood of
Sanditon had succeeded in removing
her &amp; her large Income to his own
Domains, but he c<sup>d</sup> not succeed in the
veiws of permanently enriching his
family, which were attributed to him.
She had been too wary to put anything
out of her own Power&mdash;and when on
Sir Harry’s Decease she returned again
to her own House at Sanditon, she was
said to have made this boast to a
friend “that though she had <em>got</em>
nothing but her Title from the Family,
still she had <em>given</em> nothing for it.”&mdash;For
the Title, it was to be supposed
that she had married&mdash;&amp; M<sup>r</sup> P.
acknowledged there being just such
a degree of value for it apparent now,
as to give <a href="#n33_22" id="p33_22">her conduct</a> that natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>explanation. “There is at times said
he&mdash;a little self-importance&mdash;but it is
not offensive;&mdash;&amp; there are moments,
there are points, when her Love of
Money is carried <a href="#n34_5" id="p34_5">greatly</a> too far. But
she is a goodnatured Woman, a very
goodnatured Woman,&mdash;a very obliging,
friendly Neighbour; <a href="#n34_8" id="p34_8">a chearful, independant,
valuable character</a>.&mdash;and her
faults <a href="#n34_10a" id="p34_10a">may be entirely</a> imputed to <a href="#n34_10b" id="p34_10b">her
want</a> of Education. She has good
natural Sense, but quite uncultivated.&mdash;She
has a fine active mind, as well
as a fine healthy frame for a Woman of
70, &amp; enters into the improvement of
Sanditon with a spirit <a href="#n34_16" id="p34_16">truly admirable</a>&mdash;though
now &amp; then, a Littleness <em>will</em>
appear. She cannot look forward quite
as I would have her&mdash;&amp; takes alarm at
a trifling present expence, without
considering what returns it <em>will</em> make
her in a year or two. That is&mdash;we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>think <em>differently</em>, we <a href="#n35_1" id="p35_1">now &amp; then, see
things <em>differently</em></a>, Miss H.&mdash;Those who
tell their own Story <a href="#n35_3" id="p35_3">you know</a> must be
listened to with Caution.&mdash;When you
see us in contact, you will judge for
yourself.”&mdash;Lady D. was indeed a great
Lady beyond the common <a href="#n35_7" id="p35_7">wants of
Society</a>&mdash;for she had many Thousands
a year to bequeath, &amp; three distinct
sets of People to be courted by; her
own relations, who might very reasonably
wish for her Original Thirty Thousand
Pounds among them, the legal
Heirs of M<sup>r</sup> Hollis, who must hope to
be more endebted to <em>her</em> sense of
Justice than <a href="#n35_16" id="p35_16">he had allowed them to
be</a> to <em>his</em>, and those Members of the
Denham Family, whom her 2<sup>d</sup> Husband
had hoped to make a good Bargain for.&mdash;By
all of these, or by Branches of
them, she had no doubt been long, &amp;
still continued to be, well attacked;&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
of <a href="#n36_1" id="p36_1">these</a> three divisions, M<sup>r</sup> P. did
not hesitate to say that M<sup>r</sup> Hollis’
<a href="#n36_3" id="p36_3">Kindred</a> were the <em>least</em> in favour &amp; Sir
Harry Denham’s the <em>most</em>.&mdash;The former
he beleived, had done themselves irremediable
harm by expressions of very
unwise &amp; unjustifiable resentment at
the time of Mr. Hollis’s death;&mdash;the
Latter, to the advantage of being the
remnant of a Connection which she
certainly valued, joined those of having
been known to her from their Childhood,
&amp; of being always <a href="#n36_13" id="p36_13">at hand to
preserve their</a> interest by reasonable
attention. Sir Edward, the present
Baronet, nephew to Sir Harry, resided
constantly at Denham Park; &amp; M<sup>r</sup> <span class="nowrap">P&mdash;</span> had
little doubt, that he &amp; his Sister
Miss <span class="nowrap">D&mdash;</span> who <a href="#n36_19" id="p36_19">lived</a> with him, w<sup>d</sup> be
<a href="#n36_20" id="p36_20">principally</a> remembered in her Will.
He sincerely hoped it.&mdash;Miss Denham
had a very small provision&mdash;&amp; her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span>Brother was a poor Man for his rank
in Society. “He is a warm friend to
Sanditon&mdash;said M<sup>r</sup> Parker&mdash;&amp; his hand
w<sup>d</sup> be as liberal as his heart, <a href="#n37_4" id="p37_4">had he</a>
the Power.&mdash;He would be a noble Coadjutor!&mdash;As
it is, he does what he can&mdash;&amp;
is running up a tasteful little
Cottage Ornèe, on a strip of Waste
Ground <a href="#n37_9" id="p37_9">Lady D. has granted him</a>,
which I have no doubt <a href="#n37_10" id="p37_10">we shall</a> have
many a Candidate for, before the end
even of <em>this</em> Season.” Till within the
last twelvemonth, M<sup>r</sup> P. had considered
Sir Edw: as standing without
a rival, as <a href="#n37_15a" id="p37_15a">having</a> <a href="#n37_15b" id="p37_15b">the fairest</a> chance of
succeeding to the greater part of all
that she had to give&mdash;but there was
now another person’s claims to be
taken into the account, those of the
young female relation, whom Lady D.
had been induced to receive into her
Family. After having always protested
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span>against any such Addition, <a href="#n38_1" id="p38_1">and
long &amp; often enjoyed</a> the repeated
defeats she had given to every attempt
of her <a href="#n38_4" id="p38_4">relations</a> to introduce this young
Lady, or that young Lady as a Companion
at Sanditon <a href="#n38_6" id="p38_6">House</a>, she had
brought back with her from London
last Michaelmas a Miss Brereton, who
bid fair by her Merits to vie in favour
with Sir Edward, and to <a href="#n38_10" id="p38_10">secure</a> for
herself &amp; her family that share of the
accumulated Property which they had
certainly the best right to inherit.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup>
Parker spoke warmly of Clara
Brereton, &amp; the interest of his story
increased very much with the introduction
of such a <a href="#n38_17" id="p38_17">Character</a>. Charlotte
listened with more than amusement
now;&mdash;it was solicitude &amp; Enjoyment,
as she heard her <a href="#n38_20" id="p38_20">described</a> to be lovely,
amiable, gentle, unassuming, conducting
herself uniformly with great good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>sense, &amp; evidently gaining by her innate
worth, on the affections of her Patroness.&mdash;Beauty,
Sweetness, Poverty &amp;
Dependance, do not want the imagination
of a Man to operate upon. With
due exceptions&mdash;Woman feels for
Woman very <a href="#n39_7" id="p39_7">promptly &amp;</a> compassionately.
He gave the particulars which
had led to Clara’s admission at Sanditon,
as no bad exemplification of
that mixture of Character, that union
of Littleness with Kindness with Good
Sence with even Liberality which he saw
in Lady D.&mdash; After having avoided
<a href="#n39_15a" id="p39_15a">London</a> for many years, <a href="#n39_15b" id="p39_15b">principally</a>
on account of these <a href="#n39_16a" id="p39_16a">very</a> <a href="#n39_16b" id="p39_16b">Cousins</a>,
who were continually writing, inviting
&amp; tormenting her, <a href="#n39_18" id="p39_18">&amp; whom she was
determined to keep at a distance, she
had</a> been obliged to go <a href="#n39_20" id="p39_20">there</a> last
Michaelmas with the certainty of being
detained at least a fortnight.&mdash;She had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>gone to an Hotel&mdash;living by her own
account as prudently as possible, to
defy the <a href="#n40_3" id="p40_3">reputed</a> expensiveness of such
a home, &amp; at the end of three Days
<a href="#n40_5" id="p40_5">calling</a> for her Bill, that she might
judge of her state.&mdash;It’s amount was
such as determined her on staying <a href="#n40_7" id="p40_7">not</a>
another hour in the House, &amp; she was
preparing in <a href="#n40_9" id="p40_9">all the</a> anger &amp; perturbation
<a href="#n40_10" id="p40_10">which</a> a beleif of very gross imposition
<em>there</em>, &amp; an ignorance of where to
go for better usage, to leave the Hotel
at all hazards, when the Cousins, the
politic &amp; lucky Cousins, who seemed
always to have <a href="#n40_15" id="p40_15">a spy</a> on her, introduced
themselves at this important
moment, &amp; learning her situation, <a href="#n40_17" id="p40_17">persuaded</a>
her to accept such a home <a href="#n40_18" id="p40_18">for
the rest of her stay</a> as their humbler
house in <a href="#n40_20" id="p40_20">a very</a> inferior part of London,
c<sup>d</sup> offer.&mdash;She went; was delighted
with her welcome &amp; the hospitality &amp;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span>attention she received from every body&mdash;found
her good Cousins the <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> <a href="#n41_3" id="p41_3">beyond
her expectation</a> worthy people&mdash;&amp;
finally was impelled by a personal
knowledge of their narrow Income &amp;
pecuniary difficulties, to invite one of
the girls of the family to pass the
Winter with her. The invitation was
to <em>one</em>, for six months&mdash;with the probability
of another being then to take
her place;&mdash;but in <em>selecting</em> the one,
Lady D. had shewn the good part of
her Character&mdash;for passing by the
actual <em>daughters</em> of the House, she had
chosen Clara, a Neice&mdash;, more helpless
&amp; more pitiable of course than any&mdash;a
dependant on Poverty&mdash;an additional
Burthen on an encumbered Circle&mdash;&amp;
one, who had been so low in every
worldly veiw, as with all her natural
endowments &amp; powers, to have been
preparing for <a href="#n41_22" id="p41_22">a situation</a> little better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span>than a Nursery Maid.&mdash;Clara had returned
with her&mdash;&amp; by her good sence
&amp; <a href="#n42_3" id="p42_3">merit</a> had now, to all appearance
secured a very strong hold in Lady D.’s
regard. The six months had long been
over&mdash;&amp; not a syllable was breathed of
any change, or exchange.&mdash;She was
a general favourite;&mdash;the influence of
her <a href="#n42_9a" id="p42_9a">steady conduct</a> &amp; mild, <a href="#n42_9b" id="p42_9b">gentle</a>
Temper was felt by everybody. The
prejudices which had met her at first
in some quarters, were all dissipated.
She was felt to be worthy of Trust&mdash;to
be the very companion who w<sup>d</sup> guide
&amp; soften Lady <span class="nowrap">D&mdash;</span> who w<sup>d</sup> enlarge
her mind &amp; open her hand.&mdash;She was
as thoroughly amiable as she was lovely&mdash;&amp;
since <a href="#n42_18" id="p42_18">having</a> had the advantage
of their Sanditon Breezes, <a id="Preface_1"></a><a href="#n42_19" id="p42_19">that Loveliness</a>
was complete.</p>

<p class="firstpara">“And whose very snug-looking Place
is this?”&mdash;said Charlotte, as in a
sheltered Dip within 2 miles of the
Sea, they passed <a href="#n43_4" id="p43_4">close by</a> a moderate-sized
house, well fenced &amp; planted, &amp;
rich in the Garden, <a href="#n43_6" id="p43_6">Orchard &amp; Meadows</a>
which are the best embellishments of
<a href="#n43_8" id="p43_8">such a</a> Dwelling. “It seems to have
as many comforts about it as Willingden.”&mdash;“Ah!&mdash;said
M<sup>r</sup> P.&mdash;This is my
<a href="#n43_11" id="p43_11">old</a> House&mdash;the house of my Forefathers&mdash;the
house where I &amp; all my
Brothers &amp; Sisters were born &amp; bred&mdash;&amp;
where my own 3 eldest Children
were born&mdash;where M<sup>rs</sup> P. &amp; I lived till
within the last 2 years&mdash;till our new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span>House was finished.&mdash;I am glad you
are pleased with it.&mdash;It is an honest
old Place&mdash;and Hillier keeps it in very
good order. I have given it up <a href="#n44_4" id="p44_4">you
know</a> to the Man who occupies the
cheif of my Land. <em>He</em> gets a better
House by it&mdash;&amp; I, a rather better
situation!&mdash;one other <a href="#n44_8" id="p44_8">Hill</a> brings us
to <a href="#n44_9a" id="p44_9a">Sanditon</a>&mdash;<a href="#n44_9b" id="p44_9b">modern Sanditon</a>&mdash;<a href="#n44_9c" id="p44_9c">a
beautiful Spot</a>.&mdash;Our Ancestors, you
know always built in a hole.&mdash;Here
were we, pent down in this little contracted
Nook, without Air or Veiw,
only one mile &amp; 3 q<sup>rs</sup> from the noblest
expanse of Ocean between the South
foreland &amp; the Land’s end, <a href="#n44_16" id="p44_16">&amp; without</a>
the smallest advantage from it. You
will not think I have made a bad
exchange, when we reach Trafalgar
House&mdash;which by the bye, I almost
wish I had not named Trafalgar&mdash;for
Waterloo is more the thing now. However,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>Waterloo is in reserve&mdash;&amp; if we
have encouragement enough this year
for <a href="#n45_3" id="p45_3">a little Crescent</a> to be ventured on&mdash;(as
I trust we shall) then, <a href="#n45_4" id="p45_4">we shall</a>
be able to call it Waterloo Crescent&mdash;&amp;
the <a href="#n45_6a" id="p45_6a">name</a> <a href="#n45_6b" id="p45_6b">joined to the</a> form of the

the back window with <a href="#n45_13" id="p45_13">something</a> like
the fondness of regret.&mdash;And such a
nice Garden&mdash;such an excellent Garden.”
“Yes, my Love, but <em>that</em> we
may be said to carry with us.&mdash;<em>It</em>
supplies us, as before, with all the fruit
&amp; vegetables we want; &amp; we have <a href="#n45_19" id="p45_19">in
fact</a> all the comfort of an excellent
Kitchen Garden, <a href="#n45_21a" id="p45_21a">without</a> <a href="#n45_21b" id="p45_21b">the constant
Eyesore of</a> its <a href="#n45_21c" id="p45_21c">formalities</a>; <a href="#n45_22" id="p45_22">or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span>the yearly nuisance of its</a> decaying vegetation.&mdash;Who
can endure a Cabbage
Bed in October”? “Oh! dear&mdash;yes.&mdash;<a href="#n46_4a" id="p46_4a">We</a>
are quite as <a href="#n46_4b" id="p46_4b">well off</a> for
Gardenstuff <a href="#n46_5" id="p46_5">as ever we were</a>&mdash;for if it
is forgot to be brought at any time,
we can always buy what we want at
Sanditon-House.&mdash;The Gardiner there,
is glad enough to supply us&mdash;. But it
was a nice place for the Children to run
about in. So shady in Summer!”
“My dear, we shall have shade enough
<a href="#n46_13a" id="p46_13a">on the Hill</a> &amp; more than enough <a href="#n46_13b" id="p46_13b">in the
course</a> of a very few years;&mdash;<a href="#n46_14" id="p46_14">The
Growth of my Plantations is a general
astonishment</a>. In the mean while we
have the Canvas Awning, which gives
us the most complete comfort within

Whitby’s for little Mary at any time,
or a large Bonnet at Jebb’s&mdash;and as
for the Boys, I must say I w<sup>d</sup> rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span><em>them</em> run about in the Sunshine than
not. I am sure we agree my dear, in
wishing our Boys to be as hardy as
possible.”&mdash;“Yes indeed, I am sure
we do&mdash;&amp; I will get Mary a little
Parasol, which will make her <a href="#n47_6" id="p47_6">as proud
as can be</a>. <a href="#n47_7" id="p47_7">How Grave she will walk
about with it, and</a> fancy herself quite
a little Woman.&mdash;Oh! I have not the
smallest doubt of our being a great
deal better off where we are now. If
we any of us want to <a href="#n47_12" id="p47_12">bathe</a>, we have
not a q<sup>r</sup> of a mile to go.&mdash;But you
know, (still looking back) one loves to
look at an old friend, at a place where
one has been happy.&mdash;The Hilliers
did not seem to feel the Storms last
Winter <a href="#n47_18" id="p47_18">at all</a>.&mdash;I remember seeing

Nights, when <em>we</em> had been literally
rocked in our bed, and she did not
seem at all aware of the Wind being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span>anything more than common.” “Yes,
yes&mdash;that’s likely enough. <em>We</em> have
all the Grandeur of the Storm, with
less real danger, because the Wind
meeting <a href="#n48_5" id="p48_5">with</a> nothing to oppose or

my dear Mary, merely a Joke of his.

a Hospital of it. He pretends to laugh

it might have: Many a respectable

Hill, whose side was covered with
the Woods &amp; enclosures of Sanditon
House <a href="#n51_12" id="p51_12">and whose Height ended in</a> an
open <a href="#n51_13a" id="p51_13a">Down</a> <a href="#n51_13b" id="p51_13b">where the new Build<sup>gs</sup>
might soon be looked for</a>. A branch
only, of the Valley, <a href="#n51_15" id="p51_15">winding more
obliquely</a> towards the Sea, <a href="#n51_16" id="p51_16">gave</a> a
passage to an inconsiderable Stream,
&amp; <a href="#n51_18" id="p51_18">formed</a> at its mouth, a 3<sup>d</sup> Habitable
Division, in a small cluster of Fisherman’s
Houses.&mdash;The Village contained
little more than Cottages, but the
Spirit of the day had been caught, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span>M<sup>r</sup> P. observed with <a href="#n52_1" id="p52_1">delight</a> to Charlotte,
&amp; two or three of the best of
them were smartened up with a white
Curtain &amp; “Lodgings to let”&mdash;, and
farther on, in the little Green Court of
an old Farm House, <a href="#n52_6" id="p52_6">two Females</a> in
elegant white were actually to be seen
with their books &amp; camp stools&mdash;and
in turning the corner of the Baker’s
shop, the sound of a Harp might be
heard <a href="#n52_11" id="p52_11">through the upper</a> Casement.&mdash;Such
sights &amp; sounds were highly <a href="#n52_12" id="p52_12">Blissful</a>
to M<sup>r</sup> P.&mdash;Not that he had any
personal concern in the success of the
Village itself; for considering it as too
remote from the Beach, he had done
nothing there&mdash;but it was a most valuable
proof of the increasing fashion of
the place altogether. If the <em>Village</em>
could attract, the Hill <a href="#n52_20" id="p52_20">might</a> be nearly
full.&mdash;He anticipated an amazing Season.&mdash;At
the same time last year, (late
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span>in July) there had not been a single
Lodger in the Village!&mdash;nor did he
remember any <a href="#n53_3" id="p53_3">during</a> the whole
<a href="#n53_4" id="p53_4">Summer</a>, excepting one family of children
who came from London for sea
air after the hooping Cough, <a href="#n53_6" id="p53_6">and</a> whose
Mother <a href="#n53_7" id="p53_7">would not let them be</a> nearer
<a href="#n53_8" id="p53_8">the shore</a> for fear of their tumbling in.&mdash;“Civilization,
Civilization indeed!&mdash;cried
M<sup>r</sup> <span class="nowrap">P&mdash;,</span> <span class="nowrap">delighted&mdash;.</span> Look my
dear Mary&mdash;Look at <a href="#n53_11" id="p53_11">William</a> Heeley’s
windows.&mdash;Blue Shoes, &amp; nankin
Boots!&mdash;Who w<sup>d</sup> have expected such
a sight <a href="#n53_14" id="p53_14">at a Shoemaker’s</a> in old Sanditon!&mdash;<a href="#n53_15" id="p53_15">This
is new within the Month.
There was no blue Shoe when we passed
this way a month ago</a>.&mdash;Glorious indeed!&mdash;Well,
I think I <em>have</em> done
something in my Day.&mdash;Now, for our
Hill, our health-breathing Hill.&mdash;” In
ascending, they passed the Lodge-Gates
of Sanditon House, &amp; saw the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>top of the House itself among its
Groves. It was the last Building of
<a href="#n54_3" id="p54_3">former Days</a> in that line of the Parish.
A little higher up, the Modern began;
&amp; in crossing the Down, a Prospect
House, a Bellevue Cottage, &amp; a Denham
Place were to be looked at by
Charlotte with the calmness of amused
Curiosity, &amp; <a href="#n54_9" id="p54_9">by M<sup>r</sup> P</a>. with the eager
eye which hoped to see scarcely any
empty houses.&mdash;More Bills at the Window
than he had <a href="#n54_12a" id="p54_12a">calculated</a> on;&mdash;<a href="#n54_12b" id="p54_12b">and
a smaller</a> shew of company on the Hill&mdash;Fewer
Carriages, fewer Walkers. He
had fancied it just the time of day for
them to be all returning from their
Airings to <a href="#n54_17a" id="p54_17a">dinner</a>&mdash;<a href="#n54_17b" id="p54_17b">But</a> the Sands <a href="#n54_17c" id="p54_17c">&amp;
the Terrace</a> always attracted some&mdash;.
<a href="#n54_19" id="p54_19">and the Tide</a> must be flowing&mdash;about
<a href="#n54_20" id="p54_20">half-Tide now</a>.&mdash;He longed to be on
the Sands, the Cliffs, <a href="#n54_21" id="p54_21">at his own</a> House,
&amp; everywhere out of his House <a href="#n54_22" id="p54_22">at</a>

sight of the Sea &amp; <a href="#n55_2" id="p55_2">he c<sup>d</sup> almost</a> feel his
Ancle getting stronger already.&mdash;Trafalgar
House, on the most elevated
spot <a href="#n55_5a" id="p55_5a">on the Down</a> <a href="#n55_5b" id="p55_5b">was a light</a> elegant
Building, <a href="#n55_6" id="p55_6">standing in a</a> small Lawn
with <a href="#n55_7" id="p55_7">a very young plantation round it</a>,
<a href="#n55_8" id="p55_8">about</a> an hundred yards from the <a href="#n55_9a" id="p55_9a">brow
of</a> a steep, but not <a href="#n55_9b" id="p55_9b">very lofty</a> Cliff&mdash;and
the nearest to it, of every Building,
excepting one <a href="#n55_11" id="p55_11">short</a> row of smart-looking
Houses, called the Terrace,
with a broad walk in front, aspiring to
be the Mall of the Place. In this row
were the best Milliner’s shop &amp; the
Library&mdash;<a href="#n55_16" id="p55_16">a little</a> detached from it, the
Hotel &amp; Billiard Room&mdash;Here began
the Descent to the Beach, &amp; <a href="#n55_18" id="p55_18">to the
Bathing</a> Machines&mdash;&amp; this was therefore
the favourite spot for Beauty &amp;
Fashion.&mdash;At Trafalgar House, rising
at a little distance behind the Terrace,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>the Travellers were safely set down,
&amp; all was happiness &amp; Joy between
Papa &amp; Mama &amp; their Children; while
Charlotte having received possession
of her apartment, found amusement
enough in standing at her <a href="#n56_6" id="p56_6">ample,
Venetian</a> window, &amp; looking over the
miscellaneous foreground of unfinished
Buildings, waving Linen, &amp; tops of
Houses, to the Sea, dancing &amp; sparkling
in <a href="#n56_11" id="p56_11">Sunshine &amp;</a> <span class="nowrap">Freshness.&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 5.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">When they met before dinner, M<sup>r</sup> P.
was looking over Letters.&mdash;“Not a
Line from Sidney!&mdash;said he.&mdash;He is
an idle fellow.&mdash;I sent him an account
of my accident from Willingden, &amp;
thought he would have vouchsafed me
an Answer.&mdash;<a href="#n57_7" id="p57_7">But perhaps</a> it implies
that he is coming himself.&mdash;<a href="#n57_8" id="p57_8">I trust it
may</a>.&mdash;But here is a Letter from one
of my Sisters. <em>They</em> never fail me.&mdash;Women
are the only Correspondents to
be depended on.&mdash;Now Mary, (smiling
at his Wife)&mdash;before I open it, what
shall we guess as to the state of health
of those it comes from&mdash;or rather what
w<sup>d</sup> Sidney <a href="#n57_16" id="p57_16">say</a> if he were here?&mdash;Sidney
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>is a saucy fellow, Miss H.&mdash;And you
must know, he will have it there is
a good deal of Imagination in my <a href="#n58_3" id="p58_3">two</a>
Sisters’ complaints&mdash;but it really is
not so&mdash;or very little&mdash;They have
wretched health, as you have heard
us say <a href="#n58_7a" id="p58_7a">frequently</a>, &amp; are <a href="#n58_7b" id="p58_7b">subject to
a variety of very serious</a> Disorders.&mdash;Indeed,
I do not beleive they know
what a day’s health is;&mdash;&amp; at the
same time, they are such excellent
useful Women &amp; have so much energy
of Character that, where any Good is
to be done, they force themselves on
exertions which to those who do not
thoroughly know them, have an extraordinary
appearance.&mdash;But there is
really no affectation about them. They
have only weaker constitutions &amp;
stronger minds than are often met
with, either separate or together.&mdash;And
our Youngest B<sup>r</sup>&mdash;who lives with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>them, &amp; who is not <a href="#n59_1a" id="p59_1a">much</a> above <a href="#n59_1b" id="p59_1b">20</a>,
I am sorry to say, is almost as great
an Invalid as themselves.&mdash;He is so
delicate that he can engage in no <a href="#n59_5" id="p59_5">Profession</a>.&mdash;Sidney
laughs at him&mdash;but
it really is no Joke&mdash;tho’ Sidney often
makes me laugh at them all in spite of
myself.&mdash;Now, if he were here, I know
he w<sup>d</sup> be offering odds that either
Susan Diana or Arthur <a href="#n59_10" id="p59_10">w<sup>d</sup> appear by
this letter to have been</a> at the point of
death within the last month.”&mdash;Having
run his eye over the Letter, he shook his
head &amp; <a href="#n59_14" id="p59_14">began</a>&mdash;“No chance of seeing
them at Sanditon I am sorry to say.&mdash;A
very indifferent account of them
indeed. Seriously, a very indifferent
account.&mdash;Mary, you will be quite sorry
to hear how ill they have been &amp; are.&mdash;Miss
H., if you will give me leave, I will
read Diana’s Letter aloud.&mdash;I like to
have my friends acquainted with each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span>other&mdash;&amp; I am afraid this is the only
sort of acquaintance I shall have the
means of <a href="#n60_3" id="p60_3">accomplishing between you</a>.&mdash;And
I can have no scruple on
Diana’s account&mdash;for her Letters <a href="#n60_5" id="p60_5">shew</a>
her exactly as she is, the most active,
friendly, warm hearted Being in existence,
&amp; therefore must give a good
impression.” He read.&mdash;“My dear
Tom, We were all much greived <a href="#n60_10" id="p60_10">at
your accident</a>, &amp; if you had not
described yourself as fallen into such
very good hands, I sh<sup>d</sup> have been with
you at all hazards the day after the
rec<sup>pt</sup> of your Letter, though it <a href="#n60_16a" id="p60_16a">found
me</a> <a href="#n60_16b" id="p60_16b">suffering</a> under a more severe attack
than usual of my old greivance, Spasmodic
Bile <a href="#n60_18" id="p60_18">&amp; hardly able to crawl
from my Bed to the Sofa</a>.&mdash;But how
were you treated?&mdash;Send me more
Particulars in your next.&mdash;If indeed a
simple Sprain, as you denominate it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>nothing w<sup>d</sup> have been so judicious as
Friction, Friction by the hand alone,
supposing it could be applied <em>instantly</em>.&mdash;Two
years ago I happened to be
calling on M<sup>rs</sup> Sheldon when her
Coachman sprained his foot as he was
cleaning the Carriage &amp; c<sup>d</sup> hardly limp
into the House&mdash;but by the immediate
<a href="#n61_9a" id="p61_9a">use</a> of Friction alone, <a href="#n61_9b" id="p61_9b">steadily</a> persevered
in, (&amp; I rubbed his Ancle with
my own hand for <a href="#n61_11" id="p61_11">six</a> Hours without
Intermission)&mdash;he was well in three
days.&mdash;Many Thanks my dear Tom for
the kindness with respect to us, which
had so large a share in bringing on
your accident&mdash;But pray never run
into Peril again, in looking for an
Apothecary on our account, for had
you the most experienced Man in his
Line settled at Sanditon, it w<sup>d</sup> be no
recommendation to us. We have
entirely done with the whole Medical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>Tribe. We have consulted Physician
after Phy<sup>n</sup> in vain, till we are quite
convinced that they can do nothing for
us &amp; that we must trust to our own
knowledge of our own wretched Constitutions
for any <a href="#n62_6" id="p62_6">releif</a>.&mdash;But if you
think it advisable for the interest of
the <em>Place</em>, to get a Medical Man there,
I will undertake the commission with
pleasure, &amp; have no doubt of succeeding.&mdash;I
<a href="#n62_11" id="p62_11">could soon</a> put the necessary
Irons in the fire.&mdash;As for getting to
Sanditon myself, it is quite an Impossibility.
I greive to say that I dare not
attempt it, but my feelings tell me too
plainly that in my present state, the
Sea air w<sup>d</sup> probably be the death of
me.&mdash;And neither of my dear Companions
will leave me, or I w<sup>d</sup> promote
their going down to you for a fortnight.
But in truth, I doubt whether
Susan’s nerves w<sup>d</sup> be equal to the effort.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>She has been suffering much from the
Headache <a href="#n63_2" id="p63_2">and</a> Six Leaches a day for
<a href="#n63_3a" id="p63_3a">10 days together</a> releived her <a href="#n63_3b" id="p63_3b">so little</a>
that <a href="#n63_4" id="p63_4">we</a> thought it right to change our
measures&mdash;and being convinced on
examination that much of the Evil
lay in her Gum, I persuaded her to
attack the disorder there. She has
<a href="#n63_9" id="p63_9">accordingly</a> had 3 Teeth drawn, &amp; is
decidedly better, but her Nerves are
a good deal deranged. She can only
speak in a whisper&mdash;and fainted away
twice this morning on poor Arthur’s
<a href="#n63_14" id="p63_14">trying to suppress a cough</a>. He, I am
happy to say is tolerably well&mdash;tho’
more languid than I like&mdash;&amp; I fear
for his Liver.&mdash;I have heard nothing
of Sidney since your being together in
Town, but conclude his scheme to the
I. of Wight has not taken place, or we
should have seen him in his way.&mdash;Most
sincerely do we wish you a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>Season at Sanditon, &amp; though we
cannot contribute to your Beau Monde
in person, we are doing our utmost to
send you Company worth <a href="#n64_4" id="p64_4">having; &amp;</a>

you two large Families, <a href="#n64_6" id="p64_6">one</a> a rich
West Indian from Surry, the other, a
most respectable <a href="#n64_8" id="p64_8">Girls</a> Boarding School,

not tell you how many People I have
employed in the business&mdash;Wheel within

Letter <a href="#n64_17" id="p64_17">&amp; make us laugh for half an

very pitiable or very creditable.&mdash;With
all their sufferings, you perceive how
much they are occupied <a href="#n64_22" id="p64_22">in promoting</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span>the Good of others!&mdash;So anxious for
Sanditon! Two large Families&mdash;One,

for N<sup>o</sup> 2. Denham Place&mdash;or the end
house of the Terrace,&mdash;&amp; <a href="#n65_5" id="p65_5">extra</a> Beds
at the Hotel.&mdash;I told you my Sisters
were excellent Women, Miss <span class="nowrap">H&mdash;&mdash;.”</span>
“And I am sure they must be very
extraordinary ones.&mdash;said Charlotte.
I am <a href="#n65_10" id="p65_10">astonished</a> at the chearful style
of the Letter, considering the state in
which both Sisters appear to be.&mdash;Three
Teeth drawn at once!&mdash;<a href="#n65_13" id="p65_13">frightful</a>!&mdash;Your
Sister Diana seems almost
as ill as possible, but those 3 Teeth of
your Sister Susan’s, are <a href="#n65_16" id="p65_16">more</a> <a href="#n65_17" id="p65_17">distressing</a>
than all the rest.&mdash;” “Oh!&mdash;they
are so used to the operation&mdash;to
every operation&mdash;&amp; have such Fortitude!&mdash;”
“Your Sisters know what
they are about, I dare say, but their
Measures seem to touch on Extremes.&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span>
feel that in any illness, <em>I</em> should be
so anxious for Professional advice, so
very little venturesome for myself, or
any body I loved!&mdash;But then, <em>we</em> have
been so healthy a family, that I can
be no Judge of what the habit of self-doctoring
may do.&mdash;” “Why to <a href="#n66_7" id="p66_7">own</a>

especially <a href="#n66_13" id="p66_13">Arthur</a>. I know you think
it a great pity they sh<sup>d</sup> give <em>him</em> such
a turn for being ill.&mdash;” “Well, well&mdash;my

for poor Arthur, that, at his
time of Life he sh<sup>d</sup> be encouraged to
give way to Indisposition. It <em>is</em> bad;&mdash;it

<p class="firstpara">The Party were very soon moving
after Dinner. M<sup>r</sup> P. could not be
satisfied without an early visit to the
Library, &amp; the Library Subscription
book, &amp; Charlotte was glad to see as
much, <a href="#n69_6" id="p69_6">&amp; as quickly</a> as possible, where
all was new. They were out in the very
quietest part of a Watering-place Day,
when the important <a href="#n69_9" id="p69_9">Business</a> of Dinner
or of sitting after Dinner was going on
in almost every inhabited Lodging;&mdash;here
&amp; there a solitary <a href="#n69_12" id="p69_12">Elderly</a> Man
might be seen, who was forced to move
early &amp; walk for health&mdash;but in general,
it was a thorough pause of Company,

Shops were deserted&mdash;the Straw Hats

fate both within <a href="#n70_4" id="p70_4">the House</a> &amp; without,

sitting in <a href="#n70_6" id="p70_6">her inner room</a>, reading one
of her own Novels, for want of <a href="#n70_7" id="p70_7">Employment</a>.&mdash;The

August &amp; September were the Months;&mdash;And
besides, the promised large

from her Toilette, with all her glossy
curls &amp; <a href="#n71_21" id="p71_21">smart Trinkets</a> to wait on her.&mdash;The
Library of course, afforded every

World that c<sup>d</sup> not be done without,
&amp; among so many pretty Temptations,
&amp; with so much good will for M<sup>r</sup> P.
to encourage Expenditure, Charlotte
began to feel that she must check
herself&mdash;or rather <a href="#n72_7" id="p72_7">she reflected</a> that at
two &amp; Twenty there c<sup>d</sup> be no excuse

going home again directly, the Parkers
knew that to be pressed into their
House, &amp; obliged to take her Tea with
them, would suit her best,&mdash;&amp; therefore
the stroll on the Cliff gave way to
an immediate return home.&mdash;“No, no,
said her Ladyship&mdash;I will not have
you hurry your Tea on my account.&mdash;I
know you like your Tea late.&mdash;My
early hours are not to put my Neighbours
to inconvenience. No, no, Miss
Clara &amp; I will get back to our own
Tea.&mdash;We came out with no other
Thought.&mdash;We wanted just to see <a href="#n73_20" id="p73_20">you
&amp; make sure of your</a> being really
come&mdash;, but we get back to our own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span>Tea.”&mdash;She went on however towards
Trafalgar House &amp; took possession of
the Drawing room <a href="#n74_3" id="p74_3">very quietly</a>&mdash;without
seeming to hear a word of M<sup>rs</sup> P.’s
orders to the Servant as they entered,
to bring Tea directly. Charlotte was
fully consoled for the loss of her walk,
by finding herself in company with
those, whom the conversation of the
morn<sup>g</sup> had given her a great curiosity
to see. <a href="#n74_11" id="p74_11">She observed them well</a>.&mdash;Lady
D. was of middle height, stout,
upright &amp; alert in her motions, with a
shrewd <a href="#n74_14" id="p74_14">eye, &amp;</a> self-satisfied air&mdash;but
not an unagreable Countenance&mdash;&amp;
tho’ her manner was rather downright
&amp; abrupt, as of a person who valued
herself on <a href="#n74_18" id="p74_18">being free-spoken</a>, there was
a good humour &amp; cordiality <a href="#n74_19" id="p74_19">about her</a>&mdash;a
civility &amp; readiness to be acquainted
with Charlotte herself, &amp; a heartiness
<a href="#n74_22" id="p74_22">of welcome</a> towards her old friends,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>which <a href="#n75_1" id="p75_1">was</a> inspiring the Good will, she
seemed to feel;&mdash;And as for Miss
Brereton, her appearance so completely
justified M<sup>r</sup> P.’s praise that Charlotte
thought she had never beheld a more
lovely, or more Interesting young
Woman.&mdash;Elegantly tall, regularly
handsome, with great delicacy of complexion
&amp; soft Blue eyes, <a href="#n75_9" id="p75_9">a sweetly
modest &amp; yet naturally graceful</a> Address,
Charlotte could <a href="#n75_11" id="p75_11">see in</a> her <a href="#n75_12" id="p75_12">only
the</a> most perfect representation of
<a href="#n75_13" id="p75_13">whatever Heroine might be most
beautiful &amp; bewitching</a>, in all the
numerous vol:<sup>s</sup> they had left behind
them <a href="#n75_16" id="p75_16">on M<sup>rs</sup> Whitby’s</a> shelves.&mdash;Perhaps
it <a href="#n75_17" id="p75_17">might</a> be partly oweing to her
having just issued from a Circulating
Library&mdash;but she c<sup>d</sup> not separate the
idea of a complete Heroine from Clara
Brereton. Her situation with Lady
Denham so very much in favour of it!&mdash;She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>
seemed placed with her on purpose
to be ill-used. <a href="#n76_2" id="p76_2">Such Poverty</a> &amp;
Dependance joined to <a href="#n76_3" id="p76_3">such Beauty</a>
&amp; Merit, seemed to leave no choice in
the business.&mdash;These feelings were not
the result of any spirit of Romance in
Charlotte herself. No, she was a very
sober-minded young Lady, sufficiently
well-read in Novels to supply her
Imagination with amusement, but not
at all unreasonably influenced by them;
&amp; while she pleased <a href="#n76_12a" id="p76_12a">herself</a> the <a href="#n76_12b" id="p76_12b">first
5</a> minutes with fancying the Persecutions
which <em>ought</em> to <a href="#n76_14" id="p76_14">be the Lot of</a> the
interesting Clara, especially in the form
of the most barbarous conduct on Lady
Denham’s side, she found no reluctance
to admit from subsequent observation,
that they appeared to be on very comfortable
Terms.&mdash;She c<sup>d</sup> see nothing
worse in Lady <a href="#n76_21" id="p76_21">Denham</a>, than the sort
of oldfashioned formality of always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>calling her <i>Miss Clara</i>&mdash;nor anything
objectionable in the degree of observance
&amp; attention which Clara paid.&mdash;On
one side it seemed protecting kindness,
on the other grateful &amp; affectionate
respect.&mdash;The Conversation
turned entirely upon Sanditon, its
present number of Visitants &amp; the
Chances of a good Season. It was
evident that Lady D. had more anxiety,
more fears of loss, than her Coadjutor.
She wanted to have the Place fill
faster, &amp; seemed to have many harassing
apprehensions of the Lodgings
being in some instances underlet.&mdash;Miss
Diana Parker’s two large Families
were not forgotten. “<a href="#n77_17" id="p77_17">Very</a> good, very
good, said her Ladyship.&mdash;A West Indy
Family &amp; a school. That sounds well.
That will bring Money.”&mdash;“No people
<a href="#n77_21" id="p77_21">spend</a> more freely, I beleive, than W.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>Indians.” observed M<sup>r</sup> Parker.&mdash;“Aye&mdash;so
I have heard&mdash;and because they
have full Purses, <a href="#n78_2" id="p78_2">fancy</a> themselves
equal, may be, to your old Country
Families. <a href="#n78_4a" id="p78_4a">But</a> then, they who <a href="#n78_4b" id="p78_4b">scatter</a>
their Money so freely, never think of
whether they may not be doing mischeif
by raising the price of Things&mdash;And
I have heard that’s very much
the case with your West-injines&mdash;and
if they come among us to raise the
price of our necessaries of Life, we
shall not much thank them M<sup>r</sup> Parker.”&mdash;“My
dear Madam, They can only
raise the price of consumeable Articles,
by such an extraordinary Demand for
them &amp; such a diffusion of Money
among us, as must do us more Good
than harm.&mdash;Our Butchers &amp; Bakers
&amp; Traders in general cannot get rich
without bringing Prosperity to <em>us</em>.&mdash;If
<em>they</em> do not gain, our rents must be
insecure&mdash;&amp; in proportion to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>profit must be ours eventually in the
increased value of our Houses.” “Oh!&mdash;well.&mdash;But
I should not like to have
Butcher’s meat raised, though&mdash;&amp; I
shall keep it down as long as I can.&mdash;Aye&mdash;that
young Lady <a href="#n79_6" id="p79_6">smiles</a> I see;&mdash;<a href="#n79_7" id="p79_7">I
dare say</a> she thinks me an odd sort
of a <a href="#n79_8" id="p79_8">Creature</a>,&mdash;but <em>she</em> will come to
care about such matters herself in
time. Yes, Yes, my Dear, depend upon
it, you will be thinking of the price of
Butcher’s meat in time&mdash;tho’ you may
not happen to have quite such a Servants
Hall full to feed, as I have.&mdash;And
I do beleive <em>those</em> are best off, that
have fewest Servants.&mdash;I am not a
Woman of Parade, <a href="#n79_17" id="p79_17">as all</a> the World
knows, &amp; if it was not for what I owe
to poor M<sup>r</sup> Hollis’s memory, I should
never keep up Sanditon House as I do;&mdash;it
is not for my own pleasure.&mdash;Well
M<sup>r</sup> Parker&mdash;and the other is a Boarding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>school, a French Boarding School,
is it?&mdash;No harm in that.&mdash;They’ll stay
their six weeks.&mdash;And out of such a
number, who knows but some may be
consumptive &amp; want Asses milk&mdash;&amp;
I have two Milch asses at this present
time.&mdash;But perhaps the little Misses
may hurt the Furniture.&mdash;I hope they
will have a good sharp Governess to
look after them.&mdash;” Poor M<sup>r</sup> Parker
got no more <a href="#n80_11" id="p80_11">credit</a> from Lady D. than
he had from his Sisters, for the Object
which had taken him to Willingden.
“Lord! my dear Sir, she cried, how
could you think of such a thing?
I am very sorry you met with your
accident, but upon my word you deserved
it.&mdash;Going after a Doctor!&mdash;Why,
what sh<sup>d</sup> we do with a Doctor
here? It w<sup>d</sup> be only encouraging our
Servants &amp; the Poor to fancy themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span>ill, if there was a D<sup>r</sup> at hand.&mdash;Oh!
pray, let us have none of the Tribe
at Sanditon. We go on very well as we
are. There is the Sea &amp; the Downs &amp;
my Milch-asses&mdash;&amp; I have told M<sup>rs</sup>
Whitby that if any body enquires for
a <a href="#n81_6" id="p81_6">Chamber-House</a>, they may be supplied
at a fair rate&mdash;(poor M<sup>r</sup> Hollis’s
<a href="#n81_6">Chamber-House</a>, as good as new)&mdash;and
what can People want for more?&mdash;Here
have I lived 70 good years in the
world &amp; never took Physic above twice&mdash;and
never saw the face of a Doctor
in all my Life, on my <em>own</em> account.&mdash;And
I verily beleive if <a href="#n81_14" id="p81_14">my poor</a> dear
Sir Harry had never seen one neither,
he w<sup>d</sup> have been alive now.&mdash;Ten fees,
one after another, did the Man take
who sent <em>him</em> out of the World.&mdash;I
beseech you M<sup>r</sup> Parker, no Doctors
here.”&mdash;The Tea things were brought
in.&mdash;“Oh! my dear M<sup>rs</sup> Parker&mdash;you
should not indeed&mdash;why would you do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span>so? I was just upon the point of
wishing you good Evening. But since
you are so very neighbourly, I beleive
Miss Clara <a href="#n82_4" id="p82_4">&amp; I</a> must <span class="nowrap">stay.”&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">The popularity of the Parkers brought
them some visitors the very next morning;&mdash;amongst
<a href="#n83_3" id="p83_3">them</a>, Sir Edw<sup>d</sup> Denham
&amp; his Sister, who having been at
Sanditon <span class="nowrap">H&mdash;</span> drove on to pay their
Compliments; &amp; the duty of Letter-writing
being accomplished, Charlotte
was <a href="#n83_8" id="p83_8">settled with M<sup>rs</sup> P.&mdash;</a> in the <a href="#n83_9" id="p83_9">Drawing
room</a> in time to see them all.&mdash;The
Denhams were the only ones to excite
particular attention. Charlotte was
glad to complete her knowledge of the
family by an introduction to them, &amp;
found them, the better half at least&mdash;(for
while single, the <em>Gentleman</em> may
sometimes be thought the better half,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>of the pair)&mdash;not unworthy notice.&mdash;Miss
D. was a fine young woman, but
cold &amp; reserved, giving the idea of one
who felt her consequence with Pride
&amp; her Poverty with Discontent, &amp; who
was immediately gnawed by the want
of an handsomer Equipage than the
simple Gig in which they travelled,
&amp; which their Groom was leading about
still in her sight.&mdash;Sir Edw<sup>d</sup> was much
her superior in air &amp; manner;&mdash;certainly
handsome, but yet more to be
remarked for his <a href="#n84_13" id="p84_13">very good</a> address
&amp; wish of paying attention &amp; giving
pleasure.&mdash;He came into the room remarkably
well, talked much&mdash;&amp; very
much to Charlotte, by whom he chanced
to be placed&mdash;&amp; she soon perceived
that he had a <a href="#n84_19" id="p84_19">fine</a> Countenance, a most
pleasing gentleness of Voice, &amp; a great
deal of Conversation. <a href="#n84_21" id="p84_21">She</a> liked him.&mdash;Sober-minded
as she was, she thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>him <a href="#n85_1" id="p85_1">agreable</a>, &amp; did not quarrel with
the <a href="#n85_2" id="p85_2">suspicion</a> of his finding her equally
so, which <a href="#n85_3" id="p85_3"><em>would</em> arise</a> from his evidently
disregarding his Sister’s motion to go,
&amp; persisting in his station &amp; his discourse.&mdash;I
make no apologies for my
Heroine’s vanity.&mdash;If there are young
Ladies in the World at her time of
Life, more <a href="#n85_9a" id="p85_9a">dull of Fancy</a> &amp; more <a href="#n85_9b" id="p85_9b">careless</a>
of pleasing, I know them not, &amp;
never wish to know them.&mdash;At last,
from the low French windows of the
Drawing room which commanded the
road &amp; all the Paths across the Down,
Charlotte &amp; Sir Edw: as they sat,
could not but observe Lady D. &amp; Miss
B. walking by&mdash;&amp; there was instantly
a slight change in Sir Edw:’s countenance&mdash;with
an anxious glance after
them as they proceeded&mdash;<a href="#n85_20" id="p85_20">followed</a> by
an early proposal to his Sister&mdash;not
<a href="#n85_22" id="p85_22">merely</a> for moving, but for walking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>on together to the Terrace&mdash;which
<a href="#n86_2" id="p86_2">altogether</a> gave an hasty turn to
Charlotte’s fancy, cured her of her
halfhour’s fever, &amp; placed her in
a more capable state of judging, when
Sir Edw: was gone, of <em>how</em> agreable
he had actually been.&mdash;“Perhaps there
was a good deal in his Air &amp; Address;
And his Title <a href="#n86_9" id="p86_9">did him no harm</a>.” She
was very soon in his company again.
The first object of the Parkers, when
their House was cleared of morn<sup>g</sup>
visitors was to get out themselves;&mdash;the
Terrace was the attraction to
<a href="#n86_15" id="p86_15">all</a>;&mdash;Every body who walked, must
begin with the Terrace, &amp; there, seated
on one of the two Green Benches by
the Gravel walk, they found the united
Denham Party;&mdash;but though united in
the Gross, very distinctly divided again&mdash;the
two superior Ladies being at one
end of the bench, &amp; Sir Edw: &amp; Miss B.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>at the other.&mdash;Charlotte’s first glance
told her that Sir Edw:’s air was that
of a Lover.&mdash;There could be no doubt
of his Devotion to Clara.&mdash;How Clara
received it, was less obvious&mdash;but she
was inclined to think not very favourably;
for tho’ sitting thus apart with
him (which probably she might not
have been able to prevent) her air was
calm &amp; grave.&mdash;That the young Lady
at the other end of the Bench was
doing Penance, was indubitable. The
difference in Miss Denham’s countenance,
the change from Miss Denham
sitting in cold Grandeur in M<sup>rs</sup> Parker’s
Draw<sup>g</sup>-room to be kept from silence by
the efforts of others, to Miss D. at
Lady D.’s Elbow, listening &amp; talking
with smiling attention or solicitous
eagerness, was very striking&mdash;and very
amusing&mdash;or very melancholy, just as
Satire or Morality might prevail.&mdash;Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span>
Denham’s Character was pretty
well decided with Charlotte. Sir
Edward’s required longer Observation.
He surprised her by quitting
Clara immediately on their all joining
&amp; agreeing to <a href="#n88_6a" id="p88_6a">walk, &amp;</a> <a href="#n88_6b" id="p88_6b">by addressing</a>
his attentions entirely to herself.&mdash;<a href="#n88_8a" id="p88_8a">Stationing
himself close</a> <a href="#n88_8b" id="p88_8b">by her</a>, he
seemed to mean to detach her as much
as possible from the rest of the Party
&amp; <a href="#n88_11" id="p88_11">to give</a> her the whole of his Conversation.
He began, in a tone of
great Taste &amp; Feeling, to talk of the
Sea &amp; the Sea shore&mdash;&amp; ran with
Energy through all the usual Phrases
employed in praise of their Sublimity,
&amp; descriptive of the <em>undescribable</em> Emotions
they excite in the Mind of Sensibility.&mdash;The
terrific Grandeur of the
Ocean in a Storm, its glassy surface in
a calm, it’s Gulls &amp; its Samphire, &amp; the
deep fathoms of it’s Abysses, it’s quick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span>vicissitudes, it’s direful Deceptions, it’s
Mariners tempting it in Sunshine &amp;
overwhelmed by the sudden Tempest,
All were eagerly &amp; fluently touched;&mdash;rather
commonplace perhaps&mdash;but
doing very well from the Lips of a handsome
Sir Edward,&mdash;and she c<sup>d</sup> not but
think him a Man of Feeling&mdash;till he
began to stagger her by the number of
his Quotations, &amp; the bewilderment of
some of his sentences.&mdash;“Do you remember,
said he, Scott’s beautiful Lines
on the Sea?&mdash;Oh! what a description
they convey!&mdash;They are never out of
my Thoughts when I walk here.&mdash;That
Man who can read them unmoved
must have the nerves of an Assassin!&mdash;Heaven
defend me from meeting such
a Man un-armed.”&mdash;“What description
do you mean?&mdash;said Charlotte. I remember
none at this moment, of the
Sea, in either of Scott’s Poems.”&mdash;“Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span>
not you indeed?&mdash;Nor can I
exactly recall the beginning at this
moment&mdash;But&mdash;you cannot have forgotten
his description of <span class="nowrap">Woman.&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Oh! Woman in our Hours of Ease&mdash;”</div>

<p class="noindent">Delicious! Delicious!&mdash;Had he written
nothing more, he w<sup>d</sup> have been Immortal.
And then again, that unequalled,
unrivalled address to Parental
<span class="nowrap">affection&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But while we are on the subject of
Poetry, what think you Miss H. of
Burns Lines to his <span class="nowrap">Mary?”&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">“Oh! <a href="#n90_18a" id="p90_18a">there is</a> Pathos <a href="#n90_18b" id="p90_18b">to madden</a> one!&mdash;If
ever there was a Man who <em>felt</em>, it
was Burns.&mdash;Montgomery has all the
Fire of Poetry, Wordsworth has the true
soul of it&mdash;Campbell in his pleasures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>of Hope has touched the extreme of
our Sensations&mdash;“Like Angel’s visits,
few &amp; far between.” Can you conceive
any thing more subduing, more melting,
more fraught with the deep Sublime
than that Line?&mdash;But Burns&mdash;I
confess my sence of his Pre-eminence
Miss H.&mdash;If Scott <em>has</em> a fault, it is the
want of Passion.&mdash;Tender, Elegant,
Descriptive&mdash;but <em>Tame</em>.&mdash;The Man
who cannot do justice to the attributes
of Woman is my contempt.&mdash;Sometimes
indeed a flash of feeling seems to
irradiate <a href="#n91_14" id="p91_14">him</a>&mdash;as in the Lines we were
speaking of&mdash;“Oh! Woman in our
hours of Ease”&mdash;. But Burns is always
on fire.&mdash;His Soul was the Altar in
which lovely Woman sat enshrined,
his Spirit <a href="#n91_19" id="p91_19">truly breathed</a> the immortal
Incence which is her Due.&mdash;” “I
have read several of Burn’s Poems with
great delight, said Charlotte as soon as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span>she had time to speak, but I am not
poetic enough to separate a Man’s
Poetry entirely from his Character;&mdash;&amp;
poor Burns’s known Irregularities,
greatly interrupt my enjoyment of his
Lines.&mdash;I have difficulty, in depending
on the <em>Truth</em> of his Feelings as a Lover.
I have not faith in the <em>sincerity</em> of the
affections of a Man of his Description.
He felt &amp; he wrote &amp; he forgot.” “Oh!
no no&mdash;exclaimed Sir Edw: in an
extasy. He was all ardour &amp; Truth!&mdash;His
Genius &amp; his Susceptibilities
might lead him into some Aberrations&mdash;But
who is perfect?&mdash;It were Hyper-criticism,
it were Pseudo-philosophy to
expect from the soul of high toned
Genius, the grovellings of a common
mind.&mdash;The Coruscations of Talent,
<a href="#n92_20" id="p92_20">elicited</a> by impassioned feeling in the
breast of Man, are perhaps incompatible
with some of the prosaic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span>Decencies of Life;&mdash;nor can you, loveliest
Miss Heywood&mdash;(speaking with
an air of deep sentiment)&mdash;nor can
any Woman be a fair Judge of what
a Man may be propelled to say, write
or do, by the sovereign impulses of
illimitable Ardour.” This was very
fine;&mdash;but if Charlotte understood it at
all, not very moral&mdash;&amp; being moreover
by no means pleased with his extraordinary
stile of compliment, she
gravely answered “I really know nothing
of the matter.&mdash;This is a charming
day. The Wind I fancy must
be Southerly.” “Happy, happy
Wind, to engage Miss Heywood’s
Thoughts!&mdash;” She began to think
him downright silly.&mdash;His chusing to
walk with her, she <a href="#n93_19" id="p93_19">had learnt to understand</a>.
It was done to pique Miss
Brereton. She <a href="#n93_21" id="p93_21">had</a> read it, in an
anxious glance <a href="#n93_22" id="p93_22">or two on his side</a>&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span>
why he sh<sup>d</sup> talk so much Nonsense,
unless he could do no better, was unintelligible.&mdash;He
seemed very sentimental,
very full of some Feelings or
other, &amp; very much addicted to all the
newest-fashioned hard words&mdash;had not
a very clear Brain she presumed, &amp;
talked a good deal by rote.&mdash;The
Future might explain him further&mdash;but
when there was a proposition <a href="#n94_10" id="p94_10">for
going</a> into the Library she felt that she
had had quite enough of Sir Edw: for
one morn<sup>g</sup>, &amp; very gladly accepted
Lady D.’s invitation of remaining on
the Terrace with her.&mdash;The others all
left them, Sir Edw: with <a href="#n94_16" id="p94_16">looks</a> of very
gallant despair in tearing himself away,
&amp; they <a href="#n94_18" id="p94_18">united</a> their agreableness&mdash;that
is, Lady Denham like a true great
Lady, talked &amp; talked only of her own
concerns, &amp; Charlotte listened&mdash;<a href="#n94_21" id="p94_21">amused
in considering</a> the contrast <a href="#n94_22" id="p94_22">between</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>her two companions.&mdash;Certainly, there
was no <a href="#n95_2" id="p95_2">strain of</a> doubtful Sentiment,
nor any phrase of difficult interpretation
in Lady D’s <a href="#n95_4" id="p95_4">discourse</a>. Taking
hold of Charlotte’s <a href="#n95_5" id="p95_5">arm</a> with the ease
of one who <a href="#n95_6" id="p95_6">felt that any notice from
her was an Honour</a>, &amp; communicative,
from the influence of the same conscious
Importance <a href="#n95_9" id="p95_9">or a natural</a> love of
talking, she immediately said in a tone
of great satisfaction&mdash;&amp; with a look of
arch sagacity&mdash;“Miss Esther wants me
to invite her &amp; her Brother to spend
a week with me at Sanditon House, as
I did last Summer&mdash;But I shan’t.&mdash;She
has been trying to get round me
<a href="#n95_17" id="p95_17">every way</a>, with her praise of this, &amp;
her praise of that; but I saw what she
was about.&mdash;I saw through it all.&mdash;I
am not very easily taken-in my
Dear.” Charlotte c<sup>d</sup> think of nothing
more harmless to be said, than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>simple enquiry of&mdash;“Sir Edward &amp;
Miss Denham?”&mdash;“Yes, my Dear.
<em>My young Folks</em>, as I call them sometimes,
for I take them very much by
the hand. I had them <a href="#n96_5" id="p96_5">with me</a> last
Summer about this time, for a week;
from Monday to Monday; and very
delighted &amp; thankful they were.&mdash;For
they are very good young People my
Dear. I w<sup>d</sup> not have you think that I
<em>only</em> notice them, for poor dear Sir
Harry’s sake. No, no; they are very
deserving themselves, or trust me, they
w<sup>d</sup> not be so much in <em>my</em> Company.&mdash;I
am not the Woman to help any body
blindfold.&mdash;I always take care to know
what I am about &amp; who I have to deal
with, before I stir a finger.&mdash;I do not
think I was ever over-reached in my
Life; &amp; That is a good deal for a
Woman to say that has been married
twice.&mdash;Poor dear Sir Harry (between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>ourselves) thought at first to have got
more.&mdash;But (with a bit of a sigh) He
is gone, &amp; we must not <a href="#n97_3" id="p97_3">find fault with</a>
the Dead. <a href="#n97_4" id="p97_4">Nobody could live happier
together than us</a>&mdash;&amp; he was a very
honourable Man, quite the Gentleman
of ancient Family.&mdash;And when he died,
I gave Sir Edw<sup>d</sup> his Gold Watch.&mdash;”
She said this with a look at her Companion
which implied it’s right to produce
a great Impression&mdash;&amp; seeing no
rapturous astonishment in <a href="#n97_12" id="p97_12">Charlottes</a>
countenance, added quickly&mdash;“He did
not bequeath it to his Nephew, my
dear&mdash;It was no <a href="#n97_15" id="p97_15">bequest</a>. It was not
in the Will. He <a href="#n97_16" id="p97_16">only</a> told me, &amp; <em>that</em>
but once, that he sh<sup>d</sup> wish his Nephew
to have his Watch; but <a href="#n97_18" id="p97_18">it</a> need not
have been binding, if I had not chose
it.&mdash;” “Very kind indeed! very
Handsome!”&mdash;said Charlotte, absolutely
forced to affect admiration.&mdash;“Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span>
my dear&mdash;&amp; it is not the <em>only</em>
kind thing I have done by him.&mdash;I have
been a very liberal friend to Sir Edw<sup>d</sup>.
And poor young Man, he needs it <a href="#n98_4" id="p98_4">bad</a>
enough;&mdash;For though I am <em>only</em> the
<em>Dowager</em> my Dear, &amp; he is the <em>Heir</em>,
things do not stand between us in the
way they commonly do between those
two parties.&mdash;Not a shilling do I receive
from the Denham Estate. Sir
Edw: has no Payments to make <em>me</em>.
He don’t stand uppermost, beleive me.&mdash;It
is <em>I</em> that help <em>him</em>.” “Indeed!&mdash;He
is <a href="#n98_14" id="p98_14">a very fine</a> young Man;&mdash;particularly
Elegant <a href="#n98_15" id="p98_15">in his</a> Address.”&mdash;This
was said cheifly for the sake
of saying something&mdash;but Charlotte
<a href="#n98_18" id="p98_18">directly saw that</a> it was laying her open
to suspicion by Lady D’s giving a
shrewd glance at her &amp; replying&mdash;“Yes,
yes, he is very well to look at&mdash;&amp;
it is to be hoped some Lady of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>large fortune will think so&mdash;for Sir
Edw<sup>d</sup> <em>must</em> marry for Money.&mdash;He &amp;
I often talk that matter over.&mdash;A handsome
young fellow like him, will go
smirking &amp; smiling about &amp; paying
girls compliments, but he knows he
<em>must</em> marry for Money.&mdash;And Sir Edw:
is a very steady young Man in the main,
&amp; has got very good notions.” “Sir
Edw: Denham, said Charlotte, with
such personal Advantages may be
almost sure of getting a Woman of
fortune, if he chuses it.”&mdash;This glorious
sentiment <a href="#n99_14b" id="p99_14b">seemed quite</a> <a href="#n99_14a" id="p99_14a">to</a> remove suspicion.
“Aye my Dear&mdash;That’s very
sensibly said <a id="Preface_3">cried Lady <span class="nowrap">D&mdash;</span></a> And if
we c<sup>d</sup> but get a young Heiress to S!
But Heiresses are monstrous scarce!
I do not think we have had an Heiress
here, or even a Co&mdash;since Sanditon
has been a public place. Families
come after Families, but as far as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>I can learn, it is not one in an hundred
of them that have any <a href="#n100_2" id="p100_2">real Property,
Landed or Funded</a>.&mdash;An Income perhaps,
but no Property. Clergymen
may be, or Lawyers from Town, or
Half pay officers, or Widows with only
a Jointure. <a href="#n100_7" id="p100_7">And</a> what good can such
people do anybody?&mdash;except just as
they take our empty Houses&mdash;and
(between ourselves) I think they are
great fools for not staying at home.
Now, if we could <a href="#n100_12" id="p100_12">get</a> a young Heiress
to be sent here for her health&mdash;(and if
she was ordered to drink asses milk
I could supply her)&mdash;and as soon as
she got well, have her fall in love with
Sir Edward!”&mdash;“That would be very
fortunate indeed.” “And Miss Esther
must marry somebody of fortune too&mdash;She
must get a rich Husband. Ah!
young Ladies that have no Money are
very much to be pitied!&mdash;But&mdash;after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>a short pause&mdash;if Miss Esther thinks
to talk me into inviting them to come
&amp; stay at Sanditon House, she will find
herself mistaken.&mdash;Matters are altered
with me since last Summer you know&mdash;.
I have Miss Clara with me now, which
makes a great difference.” She spoke
this <a id="Preface_4">so seriously that Charlotte</a> instantly
saw in it the evidence of real
penetration &amp; <a href="#n101_10" id="p101_10">prepared</a> for some fuller
remarks&mdash;but it was followed only by&mdash;“I
have no fancy for having my House
as full as an Hotel. I should not chuse
to have my 2 Housemaids Time taken
up all the morn<sup>g</sup>, in dusting <a href="#n101_15" id="p101_15">out Bed
rooms</a>.&mdash;They have Miss Clara’s room
to put to rights as well as my own
every day.&mdash;If they had hard Places,
they would want Higher Wages.&mdash;”
For objections of this Nature, Charlotte
was not prepared, &amp; she found it
so impossible even to affect simpathy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span>that she c<sup>d</sup> say nothing.&mdash;Lady D.
soon added, with great glee&mdash;“And
besides all this my Dear, am I to be
filling my House to the prejudice of
Sanditon?&mdash;If People want to be by
the Sea, why dont they take Lodgings?&mdash;Here
are a great many empty Houses&mdash;3
on this very Terrace; no fewer
than three Lodging Papers staring me
in the face at this very moment, Numbers
3, 4 &amp; 8. 8, the Corner House
may be too large for them, but <a href="#n102_12" id="p102_12">either</a>
of the two others are nice little snug
Houses, very fit for a young Gentleman
&amp; his sister&mdash;And so, my dear, the
next time Miss Esther begins talking
about the Dampness of Denham Park,
&amp; the Good Bathing always does her,
I shall advise them to come &amp; take
one of these Lodgings for a fortnight.&mdash;Don’t
you think that will be very fair?&mdash;Charity
begins at home you know.”&mdash;Charlotte’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
feelings were divided between
amusement &amp; indignation&mdash;but
indignation had the larger &amp; the increasing
share.&mdash;She kept her Countenance
&amp; she kept a civil Silence. She
could not carry her forbearance farther;
<a href="#n103_7" id="p103_7">but without</a> attempting to listen longer,
<a href="#n103_8" id="p103_8">&amp; only conscious that Lady D. was still
talking</a> on in the same way, allowed
her Thoughts to form themselves into
such a Meditation as this.&mdash;“She is
<a href="#n103_12" id="p103_12">thoroughly mean. I had not expected
any thing so bad</a>.&mdash;Mr. P. spoke too
mildly of her.&mdash;<a href="#n103_14" id="p103_14">His Judgement</a> is
evidently not <a href="#n103_15" id="p103_15">to be trusted</a>.&mdash;His own
Goodnature <a href="#n103_16" id="p103_16">misleads him</a>. He is too
kind hearted to see clearly.&mdash;I must
judge for myself.&mdash;And their very <em>connection</em>
prejudices him.&mdash;He has persuaded
her to engage in the same
Speculation&mdash;&amp; because their object in
that <a href="#n103_22" id="p103_22">Line</a> is the same, he fancies she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span>feels like him in others.&mdash;But she is
very, very mean.&mdash;I can see no Good
in her.&mdash;Poor Miss Brereton!&mdash;And she
makes every body mean about her.&mdash;This
poor Sir Edward &amp; his Sister,&mdash;how
far Nature meant them to be
respectable I <a href="#n104_7" id="p104_7">cannot</a> tell,&mdash;but they
are <em>obliged</em> to be Mean in their Servility
to her.&mdash;And I am Mean too, in giving
her my attention, with the appearance
of coinciding with her.&mdash;Thus it is,
when Rich People are <span class="nowrap">Sordid.”&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">The two Ladies continued walking
together <a href="#n105_2" id="p105_2">till</a> rejoined by the others,
who as they issued from the Library
were followed by a young Whitby
running off with 5 vols. under his arm
to Sir Edward’s Gig&mdash;and Sir Edw:
approaching Charlotte, said “You may
perceive what <a href="#n105_8" id="p105_8">has been our Occupation</a>.
My Sister wanted my Counsel in the
selection of some books.&mdash;We have
many leisure hours, &amp; read a great
deal.&mdash;I am no indiscriminate Novel-Reader.
The mere Trash of the
common Circulating Library, I hold
in the highest contempt. You will
never hear me advocating those puerile
Emanations which detail nothing but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>discordant Principles incapable of
Amalgamation, or those vapid tissues
of ordinary Occurrences from which no
useful Deductions can be drawn.&mdash;In
vain may we put them into a literary
Alembic;&mdash;we distil nothing which can
add to Science.&mdash;You understand me
I am sure?” “I am not quite certain
that I do.&mdash;<a href="#n106_9" id="p106_9">But</a> if you will describe the
sort of Novels which you <em>do</em> approve,
<a href="#n106_11" id="p106_11">I dare say it will</a> give me a clearer idea.”
“Most willingly, Fair Questioner.&mdash;The
Novels which I approve are such
as display Human Nature with Grandeur&mdash;such
as shew her in the Sublimities
of intense Feeling&mdash;such as exhibit
the progress of strong Passion from
the first Germ of <a href="#n106_18" id="p106_18">incipient</a> Susceptibility
to the utmost Energies of Reason
half-dethroned,&mdash;where we see the
strong spark of Woman’s Captivations
elicit such Fire in the Soul of Man as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>leads him&mdash;(though at the risk of some
<a href="#n107_2" id="p107_2">Aberration</a> from the strict line of Primitive
Obligations)&mdash;to hazard all, dare
all, <a href="#n107_4" id="p107_4">atcheive</a> all, to obtain her.&mdash;Such
are the Works which I peruse with
<a href="#n107_6" id="p107_6">delight</a>, &amp; I hope I may say, with
amelioration. They hold forth the
most splendid Portraitures of high
Conceptions, Unbounded Veiws, illimitable
Ardour, <a href="#n107_10" id="p107_10">indomptible</a> Decision&mdash;and
even when the Event is mainly
anti-prosperous to the <a href="#n107_12" id="p107_12">high-toned
Machinations of the</a> prime Character,
the potent, pervading Hero of the
Story, it leaves us full of Generous
Emotions for him;&mdash;our Hearts are
paralized&mdash;. T’were Pseudo-Philosophy
to assert that we do not feel more
enwraped by the brilliancy of his
Career, than by the tranquil &amp; morbid
Virtues of <a href="#n107_21" id="p107_21">any opposing Character</a>.
Our approbation of the Latter is <a href="#n107_22" id="p107_22">but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>Eleemosynary</a>.&mdash;These are the Novels
which enlarge the primitive Capabilities
of the Heart, &amp; which it cannot impugn
the Sense or be any Dereliction of the
character, of the most <a href="#n108_5" id="p108_5">anti-puerile</a>
Man, to be conversant with.”&mdash;“If
I understand you aright&mdash;said Charlotte&mdash;our
taste in Novels is not at all
the same.” And here they were obliged
to part&mdash;Miss D. being too much tired
of them all, to stay any longer.&mdash;The
truth was that Sir Edw: <a href="#n108_12" id="p108_12">whom circumstances
had confined very much to one
spot</a> had read more sentimental Novels
than agreed with him. His fancy had
been early caught by all the impassioned,
&amp; most exceptionable parts of
Richardsons; &amp; such Authors as have
<a href="#n108_19" id="p108_19">since appeared</a> to tread in Richardson’s
steps, so far as Man’s determined
pursuit of Woman in defiance of every
<a href="#n108_22" id="p108_22">opposition of feeling &amp; convenience</a> is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>concerned, had since occupied the
greater part of his literary hours, &amp;
formed his Character.&mdash;With a perversity
of Judgement, which must be
attributed to his not having by Nature
a very strong head, the Graces, the
Spirit, the Sagacity, &amp; the Perseverance,
<a href="#n109_8a" id="p109_8a">of the</a> <a href="#n109_8b" id="p109_8b">Villain</a> of the Story outweighed
all his absurdities &amp; all his
Atrocities with Sir Edward. With him,
such Conduct was Genius, Fire &amp; Feeling.&mdash;It
interested &amp; inflamed him;
&amp; he <a href="#n109_13" id="p109_13">was always more anxious for its</a>
<a href="#n109_14" id="p109_14">Success</a> &amp; mourned over its Discomfitures
with more Tenderness than c<sup>d</sup>
ever have been contemplated by the
Authors.&mdash;Though he owed many of
his ideas to this sort of reading, it were
unjust to say that he <a href="#n109_19" id="p109_19">read nothing</a>
else, or that his Language <a href="#n109_20" id="p109_20">were</a> not
formed on a more general Knowledge of
modern Literature.&mdash;He read all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>Essays, Letters, Tours &amp; Criticisms of
the day&mdash;&amp; with the same ill-luck
which made him derive only false Principles
from Lessons of Morality, &amp;
incentives to Vice from the History of
it’s Overthrow, he gathered only hard
words &amp; involved sentences from the
style of <a href="#n110_8" id="p110_8">our</a> most approved <span class="nowrap">Writers.&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sir Edw:’s great object in life was
to be seductive.&mdash;With such personal
advantages as he knew himself to possess,
&amp; such Talents as he did also give
himself credit for, he regarded it as his
Duty.&mdash;<a href="#n110_14" id="p110_14">He felt that he</a> was formed to
be a dangerous Man&mdash;quite in the line
of the Lovelaces.&mdash;<a href="#n110_16" id="p110_16">The very name of
Sir Edward he thought, carried some
degree of fascination with it</a>.&mdash;To be
generally gallant &amp; assiduous about
the fair, to make fine speeches to every
pretty Girl, was but the inferior part
of the Character he had to play.&mdash;Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>
Heywood, or any other young
Woman with <a href="#n111_2" id="p111_2">any</a> pretensions to Beauty,
he was entitled (according to his own
<a href="#n111_4" id="p111_4">veiws</a> of Society) to approach with
high Compliment &amp; Rhapsody on the
slightest acquaintance; but it was
<a href="#n111_7" id="p111_7">Clara alone</a> on whom he had serious
designs; it was Clara whom he meant
to seduce.&mdash;Her seduction was quite
determined on. Her Situation in every
way called for it. She was his rival in
Lady D.’s favour, she was young,
lovely &amp; dependant.&mdash;He had very
early seen the necessity of the case,
&amp; had now been long trying with
cautious assiduity to make an impression
on her heart, and to undermine
her Principles.&mdash;Clara saw through
him, &amp; had not the least intention of
being seduced&mdash;but she bore with him
patiently enough to confirm the sort
of attachment which her personal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span>Charms had raised.&mdash;A greater degree
of discouragement indeed would not
have affected Sir Edw:&mdash;. He was
armed against the highest pitch of
Disdain or Aversion.&mdash;If she could not
be won by affection, he must carry her
off. He knew his Business.&mdash;Already
had he had many Musings on the Subject.
If he <em>were</em> constrained so to act,
he must naturally wish to strike out
something new, to exceed those who
had gone before him&mdash;and he <a href="#n112_12a" id="p112_12a">felt</a> <a href="#n112_12b" id="p112_12b">a
strong</a> curiosity to <a href="#n112_13" id="p112_13">ascertain</a> whether
the Neighbourhood of Tombuctoo
might not afford some <a href="#n112_15" id="p112_15">solitary</a> House
adapted for Clara’s reception;&mdash;but
the Expence alas! of Measures in that
masterly style was ill-suited to his
Purse, &amp; Prudence obliged him to
prefer the quietest <a href="#n112_20" id="p112_20">sort</a> of ruin &amp; disgrace
for the object of his Affections,
to the more <span class="nowrap">renowned.&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">One day, soon after Charlotte’s arrival
at Sanditon, she had the pleasure of
seeing just as she ascended from the
Sands to the Terrace, a Gentleman’s
Carriage with Post Horses standing at
the door of the Hotel, as very lately
arrived, &amp; by the quantity of Luggage
taking off, bringing it might be hoped,
some respectable family determined on
a long residence.&mdash;Delighted to have
such good news for M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> P., who
had both gone home some time before,
she proceeded for Trafalgar House with
as much alacrity as could remain, after
<a href="#n113_15" id="p113_15">having been</a> contending for the last
2 hours with a very fine wind blowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>directly on shore; but she had not
reached the little Lawn, when she saw
a Lady walking nimbly behind her at
no great distance; and convinced that
it <a href="#n114_5" id="p114_5">could be</a> no acquaintance of her
own, she resolved to hurry on &amp; get
into the House <a href="#n114_7" id="p114_7">if possible before her</a>.
But the Stranger’s pace <a href="#n114_8" id="p114_8">did not allow</a>
this to be accomplished;&mdash;Charlotte
was on the steps &amp; had rung, but the
door was not opened, <a href="#n114_11" id="p114_11">when</a> the other
crossed the Lawn;&mdash;and when the
Servant appeared, they were just
equally ready for entering the House.&mdash;The
ease of the Lady, her “How do
you do Morgan?&mdash;” &amp; Morgan’s Looks
on seeing her, were <a href="#n114_17" id="p114_17">a moment’s astonishment</a>&mdash;but
another moment brought
M<sup>r</sup> P. into the Hall to welcome the
Sister he had seen from the Draw<sup>g</sup>
room, and she was soon introduced to
Miss Diana Parker. There was <a href="#n114_22" id="p114_22">a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>deal of</a> surprise <a href="#n115_1" id="p115_1">but still more</a> pleasure
in seeing her.&mdash;<a href="#n115_2" id="p115_2">Nothing c<sup>d</sup> be kinder
than her reception from both Husband
and Wife</a>. “<a href="#n115_4" id="p115_4">How</a> did she come? &amp; with
whom?&mdash;And they were so glad to find
her equal to the Journey!&mdash;And <a href="#n115_6" id="p115_6">that
she was</a> to belong to <em>them</em>, was a thing
of course.” Miss Diana P. was about
4 &amp; 30, of <a href="#n115_9" id="p115_9">middling</a> height &amp; slender;&mdash;<a href="#n115_10" id="p115_10">delicate
looking rather than sickly</a>;
<a href="#n115_11" id="p115_11">with an agreable face</a>, &amp; a very animated
eye;&mdash;<a href="#n115_12" id="p115_12">her manners resembling</a>
her Brother’s in their ease &amp; frankness,
though <a href="#n115_14" id="p115_14">with more decision</a> &amp; less mildness
in her Tone. She began an account
of herself <a href="#n115_16" id="p115_16">without delay</a>.&mdash;Thanking
them for their Invitation, but “<em>that</em>
was quite out of the question, for they
were all three come, &amp; meant to get
into Lodgings &amp; make some stay.”&mdash;“All
three come!&mdash;What!&mdash;Susan &amp;
Arthur!&mdash;Susan able to come too!&mdash;This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span>
was <a href="#n116_1" id="p116_1">better &amp; better</a>.” “Yes&mdash;we
are actually all <a href="#n116_2" id="p116_2">come</a>. Quite unavoidable.&mdash;<a href="#n116_3" id="p116_3">Nothing
else to be done</a>.&mdash;You
shall hear all about it.&mdash;But
my dear Mary, send for the Children;&mdash;I
long to see them.”&mdash;“And how
has Susan born the Journey?&mdash;&amp; how
is Arthur?&mdash;&amp; why do not we see him
here with you?”&mdash;“Susan has born
it wonderfully. She had not a wink
of sleep either the night before we set
out, or last <a href="#n116_12a" id="p116_12a">night</a> at Chichester, <a href="#n116_12b" id="p116_12b">and as</a>

when I left her she was directing <a href="#n117_1" id="p117_1">the

c<sup>d</sup> not come with me. And as for poor
Arthur, he w<sup>d</sup> not have been <a href="#n117_7" id="p117_7">unwilling</a>
himself, but there is so much Wind
that I did not think he c<sup>d</sup> safely
venture,&mdash;for I am <em>sure</em> there is Lumbago

Here M<sup>r</sup> P. drew his Chair still nearer
to his Sister, &amp; took her hand again
most affectionately as he answered
“Yes, Yes;&mdash;How active &amp; how
kind you have been!”&mdash;“The Westindians,
she continued, whom I look
upon as the <em>most</em> desirable of the two&mdash;as
the Best of <a href="#n118_13" id="p118_13">the Good</a>&mdash;prove to
be a M<sup>rs</sup> Griffiths &amp; her family. I <a href="#n118_14" id="p118_14">know
them only</a> through others.&mdash;<a href="#n118_15" id="p118_15">You must</a>
have heard me mention Miss Capper,
the particular friend of <em>my</em> very particular
friend Fanny Noyce;&mdash;now,
Miss Capper is extremely intimate with
a M<sup>rs</sup> Darling, who is on terms of constant
correspondence with M<sup>rs</sup> Griffiths
herself.&mdash;<a href="#n118_22" id="p118_22">Only</a> a <em>short</em> chain, you see,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>between us, &amp; not a Link wanting.
M<sup>rs</sup> G. meant to go to the Sea, for her
Young People’s benefit&mdash;had fixed on
the coast of Sussex, but was undecided
as to the <a href="#n119_5" id="p119_5">where</a>, wanted something
Private, &amp; wrote to ask the opinion of
her friend M<sup>rs</sup> Darling.&mdash;Miss Capper
happened to be staying with M<sup>rs</sup> D.
when M<sup>rs</sup> G.’s Letter arrived, &amp; was
consulted <a href="#n119_10" id="p119_10">on the question</a>; <em>she</em> wrote
the same day to Fanny Noyce and
mentioned it to her&mdash;&amp; Fanny all alive
for <em>us</em>, instantly took up her pen &amp;
forwarded the circumstance to me&mdash;except
as to <a href="#n119_15" id="p119_15"><em>Names</em></a>&mdash;which have but
lately transpired.&mdash;<a href="#n119_16" id="p119_16">There</a> was but <em>one</em>
thing for <em>me</em> to do.&mdash;I answered
Fanny’s Letter by the same Post &amp;
pressed for the recommendation of
Sanditon. Fanny had feared your
having no house large enough <a href="#n119_21" id="p119_21">to receive</a>
such a Family.&mdash;But I seem to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>spinning out my story to an endless
length.&mdash;You see how it was all
managed. I had the pleasure of hearing
soon afterwards by the same <a href="#n120_4" id="p120_4">simple
link of connection</a> that Sanditon <em>had
been</em> recommended by M<sup>rs</sup> Darling, &amp;
that the Westindians were very much
disposed to go thither.&mdash;This was the
state of the <a href="#n120_9" id="p120_9">case</a> when I wrote to you;&mdash;<a href="#n120_10" id="p120_10">but
two days</a> ago;&mdash;yes, the day
before yesterday&mdash;I heard again from
Fanny Noyce, saying that <em>she</em> had
heard from Miss Capper, who by a
Letter from M<sup>rs</sup> Darling understood
that M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash; has expressed herself in
a letter to M<sup>rs</sup> D. more doubtingly on
the subject of Sanditon.&mdash;Am I clear?&mdash;I
would be anything rather than not
clear.”&mdash;“Oh! perfectly, perfectly.
Well?”&mdash;“The reason of this hesitation,
was her having no connections in
the place, &amp; no means of ascertaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span>that she should have good accomodations
on <a href="#n121_2" id="p121_2">arriving there</a>;&mdash;and she was
particularly careful &amp; scrupulous on all
those matters more on account of a
certain Miss Lambe a young Lady
(probably a Neice) under her care, than
on her own <a href="#n121_7" id="p121_7">account</a> or her Daughters.&mdash;Miss
Lambe has an immense fortune&mdash;richer
than all the rest&mdash;&amp; very
delicate health.&mdash;One sees clearly
enough by <a href="#n121_11" id="p121_11">all this</a>, the <em>sort</em> of Woman
M<sup>rs</sup> G. must be&mdash;as helpless &amp; indolent,
as Wealth &amp; a Hot Climate are apt <a href="#n121_14" id="p121_14">to
make us</a>. But we are not all born to
equal Energy.&mdash;What was to be done?&mdash;I
had a few moments indecision;&mdash;<a href="#n121_17a" id="p121_17a">Whether</a>
to offer to write to <em>you</em>,&mdash;<a href="#n121_17b" id="p121_17b">or
to M<sup>rs</sup></a> Whitby <a href="#n121_18" id="p121_18">to</a> secure them a House?&mdash;but
neither pleased me.&mdash;I hate to
employ others, when I <a href="#n121_20" id="p121_20">am equal</a> to act
myself&mdash;and my conscience told me
that this was an occasion which called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span>for <a href="#n122_1" id="p122_1">me</a>. Here was a family of helpless
Invalides whom I might essentially
serve.&mdash;I sounded Susan&mdash;the same
Thought had occurred to her.&mdash;Arthur
made no difficulties&mdash;our plan was
arranged immediately, we were off
yesterday morn<sup>g</sup> at 6&mdash;, <a href="#n122_7" id="p122_7">left Chichester</a>
at the same hour today&mdash;&amp; here we
are.&mdash;” “Excellent!&mdash;Excellent!&mdash;cried
M<sup>r</sup> Parker.&mdash;Diana, you are unequal’d
in serving your friends <a href="#n122_11" id="p122_11">&amp; doing
Good to all the World</a>.&mdash;I know nobody
like you.&mdash;Mary, my Love, is not she
a wonderful Creature?&mdash;Well&mdash;and
now, what House do you design to
engage for them?&mdash;What is the size
of their family?&mdash;” “I do not at all
know&mdash;replied his Sister&mdash;have not the
least idea;&mdash;never heard any particulars;&mdash;but
I am very sure that the
largest house at Sanditon cannot be
<em>too</em> large. They are more likely to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>want a second.&mdash;I shall take only one
however, &amp; that, but for a week certain.&mdash;Miss
Heywood, I astonish you.&mdash;You
hardly know what to make of me.&mdash;I
see by your Looks, that you are
not used to such <a href="#n123_6a" id="p123_6a">quick</a> <a href="#n123_6b" id="p123_6b">measures</a>.”&mdash;<a href="#n123_7" id="p123_7">The
words</a> “Unaccountable Officiousness!&mdash;Activity
run mad!”&mdash;<a href="#n123_8" id="p123_8">had just
passed through Charlotte’s mind</a>&mdash;but
<a href="#n123_10" id="p123_10">a civil</a> answer was easy. “I dare say
I <a href="#n123_11" id="p123_11">do</a> look surprised, said she&mdash;because
these are very great exertions, &amp; I know
<a href="#n123_13" id="p123_13">what Invalides both you &amp; your Sister
are</a>.” “Invalides indeed.&mdash;I trust there
are not three People in England who
have so sad a right to that <a href="#n123_16" id="p123_16">appellation</a>!&mdash;But
my dear Miss Heywood, we are
sent into this World to be as extensively
useful as possible, &amp; where some
degree of Strength of Mind is given, it
is not a feeble body which will excuse
us&mdash;or <a href="#n123_22" id="p123_22">incline</a> us to excuse ourselves.&mdash;<a href="#n124_1" id="p124_1">The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>
World</a> is pretty much divided
between the Weak of Mind &amp; the Strong&mdash;between
those who can act &amp; those
who can <a href="#n124_4" id="p124_4">not</a>, &amp; it is the bounden Duty
of the Capable to let <a href="#n124_5" id="p124_5">no opportunity of
being useful escape them</a>.&mdash;My Sister’s
Complaints &amp; mine are happily not
often of a Nature, to threaten Existence
<em>immediately</em>&mdash;&amp; as long as we <em>can</em>
exert ourselves to be <a href="#n124_10" id="p124_10">of use of</a> others,
I am convinced that the Body is the
better, for the refreshment the Mind
receives in doing it’s Duty.&mdash;While
I have been travelling, with this object
in veiw, I have been perfectly well.”&mdash;The
entrance of the Children ended this
little panegyric on her own Disposition&mdash;&amp;
after having noticed &amp; caressed
them all,&mdash;she prepared to go.&mdash;“Cannot
you dine with us?&mdash;Is not it
possible to prevail on you to dine
with us?” was then the cry; and <em>that</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>being absolutely negatived, it was
“And when shall we see you again?
and how can we be of use to you?”&mdash;and
M<sup>r</sup> P. <a href="#n125_4" id="p125_4">warmly offered his assistance</a>
in taking the house for M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash;“I
will come to you the moment I have
dined, said he, &amp; we will go about
together.”&mdash;But this was immediately
declined.&mdash;“No, my dear Tom, upon
no account in the World, shall you stir
a step on any business <a href="#n125_11" id="p125_11">of mine</a>.&mdash;Your
Ancle wants rest. I see by the position
of your foot, that you have used it too
much already.&mdash;No, I shall go about
my House-taking directly. Our Dinner
is not ordered till six&mdash;&amp; by that time
I hope to have completed it. It is
now only ½ past 4.&mdash;As to seeing <em>me</em>
again <a href="#n125_19" id="p125_19">today</a>&mdash;I cannot answer for it;
the others will be at the Hotel all the
Even<sup>g</sup>, &amp; delighted to see you at any
time, but as soon as I get back I shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>hear what Arthur has done about our
own Lodgings, &amp; probably the moment
Dinner is over, shall be out again on
business relative to them, for we
hope to get into <a href="#n126_5" id="p126_5">some Lodgings or
other</a> &amp; be settled after breakfast tomorrow.&mdash;I
have not much confidence
in poor Arthur’s skill for Lodging-taking,
but he seemed to like <a href="#n126_9" id="p126_9">the commission</a>.&mdash;”
“I think you are doing
too much, said M<sup>r</sup> P. You will knock
yourself up. You sh<sup>d</sup> not move again
after Dinner.” “<a href="#n126_13" id="p126_13">No, indeed you should
not. cried his wife, for Dinner is such
a mere <em>name</em></a> with you all, that it can
do you no good.&mdash;I know what your
appetites are.&mdash;” “My appetite is
very much mended I assure you lately.
I have been taking some Bitters of my
own decocting, which have done wonders.
Susan never eats <a href="#n126_21" id="p126_21">I grant you</a>&mdash;&amp;
just at present <em>I</em> shall want nothing;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span>I never eat for about a week after
a Journey&mdash;but as for Arthur, he <a href="#n127_3" id="p127_3">is
only too much disposed for Food. We
are often</a> obliged to check him.”&mdash;“But
you have not told me any thing
of the <em>other</em> Family coming to Sanditon,
said M<sup>r</sup> P. as he walked with her to the
door of the House&mdash;the Camberwell
Seminary; have we a good chance of
<em>them</em>?” “Oh! Certain&mdash;quite certain.&mdash;I
had forgotten them for the
moment, but I had a letter 3 days ago
from my friend M<sup>rs</sup> Charles Dupuis
which assured me of Camberwell. Camberwell
will be here to a certainty, &amp;
very soon.&mdash;<em>That</em> good Woman (I do
not know her name) not being so
wealthy &amp; <a href="#n127_18" id="p127_18">independant</a> as M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash; can
travel &amp; chuse for herself.&mdash;I will
tell you how I got at <em>her</em>. M<sup>rs</sup> Charles
Dupuis lives almost next door to a
Lady, who has a relation lately settled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>at Clapham, <a href="#n128_1" id="p128_1">who actually attends the
Seminary and gives lessons on Eloquence
and</a> Belles Lettres to some of
the Girls.&mdash;I got that Man a Hare
from one of Sidney’s friends&mdash;and
he recommended Sanditon;&mdash;Without
<em>my</em> <a href="#n128_7" id="p128_7">appearing however</a>&mdash;M<sup>rs</sup> Charles
Dupuis managed it all.&mdash;”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">It was not a week, <a href="#n129_1" id="p129_1">since</a> Miss Diana
Parker had been told by her feelings,
that the Sea Air w<sup>d</sup> probably in her
present state, be the death of her, and
now she was at Sanditon, intending to
make some Stay, &amp; without appearing
to have the slightest recollection of
having written or felt any such thing.&mdash;It
was impossible for Charlotte not to
suspect a good deal of fancy in such
an extraordinary state of health.&mdash;Disorders
&amp; Recoveries so very much out
of the common way, seemed more like
the amusement of eager Minds in want
of employment than of actual afflictions
&amp; releif. The Parkers, were no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>doubt a family of Imagination &amp; quick
feelings&mdash;and while the eldest Brother
found vent for his superfluity of <a href="#n130_4" id="p130_4">sensation</a>
as a Projector, the Sisters were
perhaps driven to dissipate theirs in
the invention of odd <a href="#n130_6" id="p130_6">complaints</a>.&mdash;The
<em>whole</em> of their mental vivacity was
evidently not so employed; Part was
laid out in <a href="#n130_9" id="p130_9">a Zeal for</a> being useful.&mdash;It
should seem that they must either
be very busy for the Good <a href="#n130_11" id="p130_11">of others</a>,
or else extremely ill themselves. Some
natural delicacy of Constitution in fact,
with an unfortunate turn for Medecine,
especially quack Medecine, had given
them <a href="#n130_16a" id="p130_16a">an early</a> tendency <a href="#n130_16b" id="p130_16b">at</a> various
times, to various Disorders;&mdash;the rest
of <a href="#n130_18" id="p130_18">their sufferings</a> was from Fancy,
the love of Distinction &amp; the love of
the Wonderful.&mdash;They had <a href="#n130_20" id="p130_20">Charitable</a>
hearts &amp; many amiable feelings&mdash;but
<a href="#n130_22" id="p130_22">a spirit of restless activity</a>, &amp; the glory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span>of doing more than anybody else, had
their share in every exertion of <a href="#n131_2" id="p131_2">Benevolence</a>&mdash;and
there was Vanity in all
they did, as well as in all they endured.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup>
&amp; M<sup>rs</sup> P. spent a great part of
the Even<sup>g</sup> at the Hotel; but Charlotte
had only two or three veiws of Miss
Diana posting over the Down after
a House for this Lady whom she had
never seen, &amp; <a href="#n131_10" id="p131_10">who had never</a> employed
her. She was not made acquainted
with the others till the following day,
when, being removed into Lodgings &amp;
all the party continuing quite well,
their Brother &amp; Sister &amp; herself were
entreated to drink tea with them.&mdash;They
were in one of the Terrace Houses&mdash;&amp;
<a href="#n131_18" id="p131_18">she found them</a> arranged for the
Even<sup>g</sup> in a small neat Drawing room,
with a beautiful veiw of the Sea if they
had chosen it,&mdash;but though <a href="#n131_21" id="p131_21">it had been</a>
a very fair English Summer-day,&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>only was there no open window, but
the Sopha &amp; <a href="#n132_2" id="p132_2">the Table</a>, &amp; the Establishment
in general was all at the other
end of the room by a brisk fire.&mdash;Miss
<span class="nowrap">P&mdash;</span> whom, remembering the three
Teeth drawn in one day, Charlotte
approached with <a href="#n132_7" id="p132_7">a peculiar degree</a> of
respectful Compassion, was not very
unlike her Sister in person or manner&mdash;tho’
more thin &amp; worn by Illness &amp;
Medecine, more relaxed in air, &amp; more
subdued in voice. She talked however,
the whole Evening as incessantly
as Diana&mdash;&amp; <a href="#n132_14" id="p132_14">excepting</a> that she sat
with salts in her hand, took Drops two
or three times from one, out of <a href="#n132_16" id="p132_16">the
several</a> Phials already <a href="#n132_17" id="p132_17">at home</a> on the
Mantlepeice,&mdash;&amp; made a great many
odd faces &amp; contortions, Charlotte could
perceive no <a href="#n132_20" id="p132_20">symptoms</a> of illness which
she, in the boldness of her own good
health, w<sup>d</sup> not have undertaken to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>cure, by putting out the fire, opening
the Window, &amp; disposing of the Drops
&amp; <a href="#n133_3" id="p133_3">the salts</a> by means of one or the
other. She had had <a href="#n133_4" id="p133_4">considerable</a> curiosity
to see M<sup>r</sup> Arthur Parker; &amp; having
<a href="#n133_6" id="p133_6">fancied him</a> a very puny, delicate-looking
young Man, the smallest very
materially of not a robust Family,
was astonished to find him quite as
tall as his Brother &amp; a great deal
Stouter&mdash;Broad made &amp; Lusty&mdash;and
<a href="#n133_12" id="p133_12">with</a> no other look of an Invalide, than
a sodden complexion.&mdash;Diana was evidently
the cheif of the family; principal
Mover &amp; Actor;&mdash;she had been
on her Feet the whole Morning, on
M<sup>rs</sup> G.’s business or their own, &amp; was
still the most alert of the three.&mdash;Susan
had only superintended their
final removal from the Hotel, bringing
two heavy Boxes herself, &amp; Arthur had
found the air so cold that he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span>merely walked from one House to the
other as nimbly as he could,&mdash;&amp; boasted
<a href="#n134_3" id="p134_3">much</a> of sitting by the fire till he had
cooked up a very good one.&mdash;Diana,
whose exercise had been too domestic
to admit of calculation, but who, by
her own account, had not once sat
down <a href="#n134_8" id="p134_8">during</a> the space of seven hours,
confessed herself a little tired. She
had been too successful however for
much fatigue; for not only had she
by walking &amp; talking down a thousand
difficulties at last secured a proper
House at 8<sup>g</sup> p<sup>r</sup> week for M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash;;
she had <a href="#n134_15" id="p134_15">also opened</a> so many Treaties
with Cooks, Housemaids, Washerwomen
&amp; Bathing Women, that M<sup>rs</sup> G.
would have little more to do on her
arrival, than to wave her hand &amp;
collect them around her for choice.&mdash;Her
concluding effort in the cause, had
been a few polite lines of Information
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>to M<sup>rs</sup> G. herself&mdash;time not allowing
for the circuitous train of intelligence
which had <a href="#n135_3" id="p135_3">been hitherto</a> kept up,&mdash;and
she was now regaling in the delight
of <a href="#n135_5" id="p135_5">opening</a> the first Trenches of an
acquaintance with such a powerful discharge
of unexpected Obligation. M<sup>r</sup>
&amp; M<sup>rs</sup> P.&mdash; &amp; Charlotte had seen two
Post chaises crossing the Down to the
Hotel as they were setting off,&mdash;a joyful
sight&mdash;&amp; full of speculation.&mdash;The
Miss Ps&mdash; &amp; Arthur had also <a href="#n135_12" id="p135_12">seen
something</a>;&mdash;they could <a href="#n135_13" id="p135_13">distinguish
from their window</a> that there <em>was</em> an
arrival at the Hotel, but not <a href="#n135_15" id="p135_15">its amount</a>.
Their Visitors answered for two Hack-Chaises.&mdash;Could
it be the Camberwell
Seminary?&mdash;No&mdash;No.&mdash;Had there been
a 3<sup>d</sup> carriage, perhaps it might; but
it was very generally agreed that two
Hack chaises could never contain a
Seminary.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> P. was confident of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>another new Family.&mdash;When they were
all finally seated, after <a href="#n136_2" id="p136_2">some removals
to look</a> at the Sea &amp; the Hotel, Charlotte’s
place was by Arthur, who was
sitting <a href="#n136_5" id="p136_5">next</a> to the Fire with a degree
of Enjoyment which gave a good deal
of merit to his <a href="#n136_7" id="p136_7">civility in wishing her
to take his</a> Chair.&mdash;There was nothing
dubious in her manner of declining it,
and he sat down again with <a href="#n136_10" id="p136_10">much</a>
satisfaction. She drew back her Chair
to have all the advantage of <a href="#n136_12" id="p136_12">his Person
as</a> a screen, &amp; was very thankful for
every inch of Back &amp; Shoulders beyond
her pre-conceived idea. <a href="#n136_15" id="p136_15">Arthur was
heavy in Eye as well as figure, but by
no means</a> indisposed to talk;&mdash;and
while the other 4 were <a href="#n136_18" id="p136_18">cheifly</a> engaged
together, <a href="#n136_19" id="p136_19">he evidently</a> felt it no penance
to have <a href="#n136_20" id="p136_20">a fine young Woman</a> next to
him, requiring in common Politeness
some attention&mdash;as his <a href="#n136_22" id="p136_22">B<sup>r</sup></a>, who felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>the <a href="#n137_1" id="p137_1">decided</a> want of some motive for
action, <a href="#n137_2a" id="p137_2a">some</a> <a href="#n137_2b" id="p137_2b">Powerful object</a> of animation
for <a href="#n137_3a" id="p137_3a">him</a>, observed with <a href="#n137_3b" id="p137_3b">considerable</a>
pleasure.&mdash;Such was the influence of
Youth &amp; Bloom that he <a href="#n137_5" id="p137_5">began even to
make</a> a sort of apology for having a
Fire. “We sh<sup>d</sup> not have one at home,
said he, but the Sea air is always
damp. I am not afraid of any thing so
much as Damp.&mdash;” “I am so fortunate,
said C. as never to know whether
the air is damp or dry. It has always
some property that is wholesome <a href="#n137_13" id="p137_13">&amp;
invigorating to</a> me.&mdash;” “<em>I</em> like the
Air too, as <a href="#n137_15" id="p137_15">well as any body</a> can;
replied Arthur, I am very fond of
standing at an open Window when
there is no Wind&mdash;but unluckily a
Damp air does not like <em>me</em>.&mdash;It gives
me the Rheumatism.&mdash;You are not
rheumatic I suppose?&mdash;” “Not at
all.” “That’s a great blessing.&mdash;But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>perhaps you are nervous.” “No&mdash;I
beleive not. I have no idea that I
am.”&mdash;“<em>I</em> am very nervous.&mdash;<a href="#n138_3" id="p138_3">To say
the truth</a> Nerves are the worst part of
my Complaints <a href="#n138_5" id="p138_5">in <em>my</em> opinion</a>.&mdash;My
Sisters think me Bilious, but I doubt
it.&mdash;” “You are quite in the right, to
doubt it as long as you possibly can,
I am sure.&mdash;” “If I were Bilious, he
continued, you know Wine w<sup>d</sup> disagree
with me, but it always does me good.&mdash;The
more Wine I drink (in Moderation)
the better I am.&mdash;I am always best of
an Even<sup>g</sup>.&mdash;If you had seen me today
before Dinner, you w<sup>d</sup> have <a href="#n138_15" id="p138_15">thought</a>
me a very poor Creature.&mdash;” Charlotte
could beleive it&mdash;. She kept her
countenance however, &amp; said&mdash;“As
far as I can understand what nervous
complaints are, I have a great idea of
the efficacy of air &amp; exercise for them:&mdash;daily,
regular Exercise;&mdash;and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span>should recommend rather more of it
to <em>you</em> than I suspect you are in the
habit of taking.”&mdash;“Oh! I am very
fond of exercise myself&mdash;he replied&mdash;&amp;
mean to <a href="#n139_5" id="p139_5">walk</a> a great deal while I
am here, if the Weather is temperate.
I shall be out every morning before
breakfast&mdash;&amp; take several turns upon
the Terrace, &amp; you will often see me
at Trafalgar House.”&mdash;“But you do
not call a walk to Traf: H. much
exercise?&mdash;” “Not, <a href="#n139_12" id="p139_12">as to</a> mere distance,
but <a href="#n139_13" id="p139_13">the Hill is so steep</a>!&mdash;Walking
up that Hill, in the middle of
the day, would throw me into such a
Perspiration!&mdash;You would see me all
in a Bath by the time I got there!&mdash;I
am very subject to <a href="#n139_18" id="p139_18">Perspiration</a>, and
there cannot be a surer sign of Nervousness.&mdash;”
They were now advancing so
deep in Physics, that Charlotte <a href="#n139_21" id="p139_21">veiwed</a>
the entrance of the Servant with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>Tea things, as a very fortunate Interruption.&mdash;It
produced a great &amp; immediate
change. The young Man’s
attentions were instantly lost. He took
his own <a href="#n140_5" id="p140_5">Cocoa</a> from the Tray,&mdash;which
seemed provided with almost as many
Teapots &amp;c as there were persons in
company, Miss P. drinking one sort of
Herb-Tea &amp; Miss Diana another, &amp;
turning completely to the Fire, sat
coddling &amp; cooking it to his own
satisfaction &amp; toasting some Slices of
Bread, <a href="#n140_13" id="p140_13">brought up</a> ready-prepared in
the Toast rack&mdash;and till it was all
done, she heard nothing of his voice
but <a href="#n140_16" id="p140_16">the murmuring of a few broken
sentences of self-approbation &amp; success</a>.&mdash;When
his Toils were over however,
he moved back his Chair <a href="#n140_19" id="p140_19">into as gallant
a Line as ever</a>, &amp; proved that he had
not been working only for himself,
by his earnest invitation to her to take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span>both Cocoa &amp; Toast.&mdash;She was already
helped to Tea&mdash;which surprised him&mdash;so
totally self-engrossed had he been.&mdash;“I
thought I should have been in
time, said he, but cocoa takes a great
deal of Boiling.”&mdash;“I am much obliged
to you, replied Charlotte&mdash;but I <em>prefer</em>
Tea.” “Then I will help myself, said
he.&mdash;A large <a href="#n141_9" id="p141_9">Dish of rather</a> weak Cocoa
every evening, agrees with me better
than any thing.”&mdash;It struck her however,
as he poured out this rather weak
Cocoa, that it came forth in a <a href="#n141_13" id="p141_13">very
fine</a>, dark coloured stream&mdash;and at
the same moment, his Sisters both
crying out&mdash;“Oh! Arthur, you get
your Cocoa stronger &amp; stronger every
Even<sup>g</sup>”&mdash;, with Arthur’s somewhat
conscious reply of “T<em>is</em> rather stronger
than it should be tonight”&mdash;convinced
her that Arthur was <a href="#n141_21" id="p141_21">by no means</a> so
fond of being starved as they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>desire, or as he felt proper himself.&mdash;He
was <a href="#n142_2" id="p142_2">certainly</a> very happy to turn
the conversation on dry Toast, &amp; hear
no more <a href="#n142_4" id="p142_4">of his sisters</a>.&mdash;“I hope you
will eat some of this Toast, said he,
I reckon myself a very good Toaster;
I never burn my Toasts&mdash;I never put
them too near the Fire at first&mdash;&amp; yet,
you see, there is not a Corner but
what is well browned.&mdash;I hope you
like dry Toast.”&mdash;“With a reasonable
quantity of Butter spread over it, very
much&mdash;said Charlotte&mdash;but not otherwise.&mdash;”
“No more do <span class="nowrap">I&mdash;said</span> he
<a href="#n142_15" id="p142_15">exceedingly pleased</a>&mdash;We think quite
alike <a href="#n142_16" id="p142_16">there</a>.&mdash;So far from dry Toast
being wholesome, <em>I</em> think it <a href="#n142_17" id="p142_17">a very
bad thing</a> for the Stomach. Without
a little butter to soften it, it hurts the
Coats of the Stomach. I am sure it
does.&mdash;I will have the pleasure of
spreading some for you directly&mdash;&amp;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>afterwards I will spread some for myself.&mdash;Very
bad indeed for the Coats
of the Stomach&mdash;but there is no convincing
<em>some</em> people.&mdash;It irritates &amp;
acts like a <a href="#n143_5" id="p143_5">nutmeg grater</a>.&mdash;” He could
not get the command of the <a href="#n143_6" id="p143_6">Butter</a>
however, without a struggle; His
Sisters <a href="#n143_8a" id="p143_8a">accusing</a> him of eating a great
deal too much, &amp; <a href="#n143_8b" id="p143_8b">declaring</a> he was
not to be <a href="#n143_10" id="p143_10">trusted;&mdash;and</a> he <a href="#n143_8c" id="p143_8c">maintaining</a>
that he only eat enough to secure
the Coats of his Stomach;&mdash;&amp; besides,
he only wanted it now for Miss Heywood.&mdash;Such
a plea must prevail, he
got the butter &amp; spread away for her
with an accuracy of Judgement which
at least delighted himself; but when
<a href="#n143_18a" id="p143_18a">her Toast</a> was done, &amp; he took his <a href="#n143_18b" id="p143_18b">own</a>
in hand, Charlotte c<sup>d</sup> hardly contain
<a href="#n143_20" id="p143_20">herself</a> as she saw him watching his
sisters, while he scrupulously <a href="#n143_22" id="p143_22">scraped
off almost</a> as much butter as he put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>on, &amp; then seize an odd moment for
adding a great dab just before it went
into his Mouth.&mdash;Certainly, M<sup>r</sup> Arthur
P.’s enjoyments in Invalidism were
very different from his sisters&mdash;by no
means so spiritualized.&mdash;A good deal
of <a href="#n144_7" id="p144_7">Earthy Dross</a> hung about him.
<a href="#n144_8" id="p144_8">Charlotte could not but suspect him
of adopting</a> that line of Life, <a href="#n144_9" id="p144_9">principally</a>
for the indulgence of an indolent
Temper&mdash;&amp; to be determined on
having no Disorders but such as called
for warm rooms &amp; good Nourishment.&mdash;In
one particular however, she soon
found that he had caught something
from <em>them</em>.&mdash;“What! said he&mdash;Do you
venture upon two dishes of strong
Green Tea in one Even<sup>g</sup>?&mdash;What
Nerves you must have!&mdash;How I envy
you.&mdash;Now, if <em>I</em> were to swallow only
one such dish&mdash;what do you think it’s
effect would be upon me?&mdash;” “Keep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>you awake perhaps all night”&mdash;replied
Charlotte, meaning to overthrow his
attempts at Surprise, by the Grandeur
of her own Conceptions.&mdash;“Oh! if
that were all!&mdash;he exclaimed.&mdash;No&mdash;it
<a href="#n145_6" id="p145_6">acts on me like Poison and</a> w<sup>d</sup>
entirely take away the use of my right
side, before I had swallowed it 5
minutes.&mdash;It <a href="#n145_9" id="p145_9">sounds almost incredible</a>&mdash;but
it has happened to me <a href="#n145_10" id="p145_10">so often
that I cannot doubt it</a>.&mdash;The use of
my right Side is entirely taken away
for several hours!” “It sounds rather
odd to be sure&mdash;answered Charlotte
coolly&mdash;but I dare say it would be
proved to be the simplest thing in the
World, by those who have studied
right sides &amp; Green Tea scientifically
&amp; thoroughly understand all the possibilities
of their action on each other.”&mdash;<a href="#n145_21" id="p145_21">Soon</a>
after Tea, a Letter was brought
to Miss D. <span class="nowrap">P&mdash;</span> from the Hotel.&mdash;“From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>
M<sup>rs</sup> Charles Dupuis&mdash;said she.&mdash;some
private hand.”&mdash;And having
read a few lines, exclaimed aloud
“Well, this is very extraordinary!
very extraordinary indeed!&mdash;That both
should have the same name.&mdash;Two M<sup>rs</sup>
Griffiths!&mdash;This is a Letter of recommendation
&amp; introduction to me, of
the Lady from Camberwell&mdash;&amp; <em>her</em>
name happens to be Griffiths too.&mdash;”
A few lines more however, <a href="#n146_11" id="p146_11">and the
colour rushed</a> into her Cheeks, &amp; with
<a href="#n146_13" id="p146_13">much</a> Perturbation she added&mdash;“The
oddest thing that ever was!&mdash;a Miss
Lambe too!&mdash;a young Westindian of
large Fortune.&mdash;But it <em>cannot</em> be the
same.&mdash;Impossible that it should be
the same.”&mdash;She read the Letter aloud
for comfort.&mdash;It was merely to “introduce
the Bearer, M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash; from Camberwell,
&amp; the three young Ladies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span>under her care, to Miss D. P.’s notice.&mdash;M<sup>rs</sup>
G.&mdash; being a stranger at Sanditon,
was anxious for a respectable Introduction&mdash;&amp;
M<sup>rs</sup> C. Dupuis therefore,
at the instance of the intermediate
friend, provided her with this Letter,
knowing that she c<sup>d</sup> not do her dear
Diana a greater kindness than by
giving her the means of being useful.&mdash;M<sup>rs</sup>
G.’s cheif solicitude w<sup>d</sup> be for the
accomodation &amp; comfort of one of the
young Ladies under her care, a Miss
Lambe, a young W. Indian of large
Fortune, in delicate health.”&mdash;“It was
very strange!&mdash;very remarkable!&mdash;very
extraordinary” but they were
all agreed in <a href="#n147_16" id="p147_16">determ[in]ing</a> it to be
<em>impossible</em> that there should not be
two <a href="#n147_18" id="p147_18">Families</a>; such a totally distinct
set of people as were concerned in the
reports of <a href="#n147_20" id="p147_20">each</a> made that matter quite
certain. There <em>must</em> be two Families.&mdash;Impossible
to be otherwise. “Impossible”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span>&amp; “Impossible”, was repeated
over &amp; over again with great
fervour.&mdash;An accidental resemblance
of Names &amp; circumstances, however
striking at first, involved nothing really
incredible&mdash;and so it was settled.&mdash;Miss
Diana herself derived an immediate
<a href="#n148_8" id="p148_8">advantage</a> to counterbalance her
Perplexity. She must put her shawl
over her shoulders, &amp; be running about
again. Tired as she was, she must
instantly repair to the Hotel, to investigate
the truth &amp; offer her <span class="nowrap">services.&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="firstpara">It would not do.&mdash;Not all that the
whole Parker <a href="#n149_2" id="p149_2">race</a> could say among
themselves, c<sup>d</sup> produce a happier catastrophe
than <a href="#n149_4" id="p149_4">that the Family</a> from
Surry &amp; the Family from Camberwell
<a href="#n149_6" id="p149_6">were</a> one &amp; the same.&mdash;The rich Westindians,
&amp; the young Ladies Seminary
had all entered Sanditon in those two
Hack chaises. The M<sup>rs</sup> G. who in her
friend M<sup>rs</sup> Darling’s hands, had wavered
as to coming &amp; been unequal to the
Journey, was the very same M<sup>rs</sup> G.
whose plans were at the same <a href="#n149_13" id="p149_13">period</a>
(under <a href="#n149_14" id="p149_14">another representation</a>) perfectly
decided, &amp; who was without
fears or difficulties.&mdash;All that had the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span>appearance of Incongruity in the reports
of the two, might very fairly be
placed to the account of the Vanity,
the Ignorance, or the <a href="#n150_4a" id="p150_4a">blunders</a> <a href="#n150_4b" id="p150_4b">of the
many</a> engaged in the cause by the
vigilance &amp; caution of Miss Diana <span class="nowrap">P&mdash;.</span>
<em>Her</em> intimate friends must be officious
like herself, &amp; the subject had supplied
Letters &amp; Extracts &amp; Messages enough
to <a href="#n150_10" id="p150_10">make everything appear what it
was not</a>. Miss D. probably felt a little
awkward on being first obliged to
admit her mistake. A long Journey
from Hampshire taken for nothing&mdash;a
Brother disappointed&mdash;an <a href="#n150_15" id="p150_15">expensive
House</a> on her hands for a week, must
have been some of her immediate
reflections&mdash;&amp; much worse than all
the rest, must have been the sort of
sensation of being less clear-sighted &amp;
infallible than she had <a href="#n150_21" id="p150_21">beleived herself</a>.&mdash;No
part of it however seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span>to trouble her long. There were so
many to share in the shame &amp; the
blame, that probably when she had
divided out their proper portions to
M<sup>rs</sup> Darling, Miss Capper, Fanny
Noyce, M<sup>rs</sup> C. Dupuis &amp; <a href="#n151_6" id="p151_6">M<sup>rs</sup> C. D’s</a>
Neighbour, there might be a <a href="#n151_7" id="p151_7">mere
trifle</a> <a href="#n151_8" id="p151_8">of reproach</a> remaining for herself.&mdash;At
any rate, she was seen <a href="#n151_9" id="p151_9">all
the following</a> morn<sup>g</sup> walking about
after Lodgings with M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash; as alert
as ever.&mdash;M<sup>rs</sup> G. was a very well-behaved,
genteel kind of Woman, who
supported herself by <a href="#n151_14" id="p151_14">receiving such</a>
great girls &amp; young Ladies, <a href="#n151_15" id="p151_15">as</a> wanted
either Masters for finishing their
Education, or a home for beginning
their Displays.&mdash;She had several more
under her care than the three who were
now come to Sanditon, but the others
all happened to be absent.&mdash;Of these
three, &amp; indeed of all, Miss Lambe was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span>beyond comparison the most important
&amp; precious, as she paid in proportion
to her fortune.&mdash;She was about 17,
half Mulatto, chilly &amp; tender, had a
maid of her own, was to have the best
room in the Lodgings, &amp; was always of
the first consequence in every plan
of M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash;The other Girls, two Miss
Beauforts were just such young Ladies
as may be met with, in at least one
family out of three, throughout the
Kingdom; they had tolerable complexions,
shewey figures, an upright
decided carriage &amp; an assured Look;&mdash;they
were very accomplished &amp; very
Ignorant, their time being divided
between <a href="#n152_17" id="p152_17">such pursuits</a> as might attract
<a href="#n152_18" id="p152_18">admiration</a>, &amp; those Labours &amp; Expedients
of dexterous Ingenuity, by
which they could dress in a stile much
beyond what they <em>ought</em> to have
afforded; they were some of the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>in every change of fashion&mdash;&amp; the
object of all, was to captivate some
Man of much better fortune than their
own.&mdash;M<sup>rs</sup> G. had preferred a small,
retired place, like Sanditon, on Miss
Lambe’s account&mdash;and the Miss Bs&mdash;,
though naturally preferring any thing
to <a href="#n153_8a" id="p153_8a">Smallness &amp; Retirement</a>, <a href="#n153_8b" id="p153_8b">yet having</a>
<a href="#n153_9" id="p153_9">in the course of the Spring</a> been involved
in <a href="#n153_10" id="p153_10">the inevitable</a> expence of
six new <a href="#n153_11" id="p153_11">Dresses each</a> for a three days
visit, were constrained to be satisfied
with Sanditon also, till their circumstances
were retreived. There, with
the hire of a Harp for one, &amp; the
purchase of some Drawing paper for
the other &amp; all the finery they could
already command, they meant to be
very economical, very elegant &amp; very
<a href="#n153_20" id="p153_20">secluded</a>; with the hope on Miss Beaufort’s
side, of praise &amp; <a href="#n153_21" id="p153_21">celebrity from</a>
all who walked within the sound of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>her Instrument, &amp; on Miss Letitia’s,
of curiosity &amp; rapture in all who came
near her while she sketched&mdash;and to
Both, the consolation of meaning to be
the most stylish Girls in the Place.&mdash;The
particular introduction of M<sup>rs</sup> G.
to Miss Diana Parker, secured them
immediately an acquaintance with the
Trafalgar House-family, &amp; with the
Denhams;&mdash;and the Miss Beauforts
were soon satisfied with “the Circle in
which they moved <a href="#n154_12" id="p154_12">in Sanditon</a>” to
use a proper phrase, for every body
must now “move in a Circle”,&mdash;<a href="#n154_14" id="p154_14">to the
prevalence</a> of which rototory Motion,
is perhaps to be attributed the Giddiness
&amp; false steps of many.&mdash;Lady
Denham had other motives for calling
on M<sup>rs</sup> G. besides attention to the
Parkers.&mdash;In Miss Lambe, here was
the very young Lady, sickly &amp; rich,
whom she had <a href="#n154_22" id="p154_22">been asking for</a>; &amp; she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>made the acquaintance for Sir Edward’s
sake, &amp; the sake of her Milch
asses. How it might answer with
regard to the Baronet, remained to be
proved, but as to the Animals, she
<a href="#n155_6" id="p155_6">soon found</a> that all her calculations of
Profit w<sup>d</sup> <a href="#n155_7" id="p155_7">be vain</a>. M<sup>rs</sup> G. would not
allow Miss L. to have the smallest
symptom of a Decline, or <a href="#n155_9" id="p155_9">any complaint</a>
which Asses milk c<sup>d</sup> possibly
releive. “Miss L. was under the constant
care of an experienced <a href="#n155_12" id="p155_12">Physician</a>;&mdash;and
his Prescriptions must be their
rule”&mdash;and except in favour of some
Tonic Pills, which a Cousin of her own
had a Property in, M<sup>rs</sup> G. did never
deviate from the strict Medecinal page.&mdash;The
corner house of the Terrace was
the one in which Miss D. P. had the
pleasure of settling her new friends, &amp;
considering that it commanded in front
the favourite Lounge of all the Visitors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>at Sanditon, &amp; on one side, whatever
might be going on at the Hotel, there
c<sup>d</sup> not have been a more favourable
spot for the seclusions of the Miss
Beauforts. And <a href="#n156_5" id="p156_5">accordingly</a>, long
before they had suited themselves
with an Instrument, or <a href="#n156_7" id="p156_7">with Drawing
paper</a>, they had, by the frequency of
their appearance at the low Windows
upstairs, in order to close the blinds,
or open the Blinds, to arrange a flower
pot on the Balcony, or look at nothing
through a Telescope, attracted many
<a href="#n156_14" id="p156_14">an eye upwards</a>, &amp; made many a
Gazer gaze again.&mdash;A little Novelty
has a great effect in so small a place;
the Miss Beauforts, who w<sup>d</sup> have been
nothing at Brighton, could not move
here without <a href="#n156_19" id="p156_19">notice</a>;&mdash;and even M<sup>r</sup>
Arthur Parker, though little <a href="#n156_20" id="p156_20">disposed</a>
for supernumerary exertion, always
<a href="#n156_22a" id="p156_22a">quitted</a> the Terrace, in his <a href="#n156_22b" id="p156_22b">way</a> to <a href="#n156_22c" id="p156_22c">his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span>Brothers</a> by this corner House, for the
sake of a glimpse of the Miss Bs&mdash;,
though it was ½ a q<sup>r</sup> of a mile <a href="#n157_3" id="p157_3">round
about</a>, &amp; added two steps to the ascent
of the Hill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12.</h2>
</div>

<p class="firstpara">Charlotte had been 10 days at
Sanditon without seeing Sanditon
House, every attempt at calling on
Lady D. having been defeated by
meeting with her beforehand. But
now it was to be more resolutely
undertaken, at a more early hour,
that nothing might be neglected of
attention to Lady D. or amusement to
Charlotte.&mdash;“And if you should find
a favourable opening my Love, said
M<sup>r</sup> P. (who did not mean to go with
them)&mdash;I think you had <a href="#n159_13" id="p159_13">better mention</a>
the poor Mullins’s situation, &amp;
sound her Ladyship as to a Subscription
for them. I am not fond of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>charitable subscriptions in a place of
this kind&mdash;It is a sort of tax upon all
that come&mdash;Yet as their distress is
very great &amp; I almost promised the
poor Woman yesterday to get something
done for her, I beleive we must
set a subscription on <a href="#n160_7" id="p160_7">foot</a>&mdash;&amp; therefore
the sooner the better,&mdash;&amp; Lady
Denham’s name at the head of the
List will be a very necessary beginning.&mdash;You
will not dislike speaking to her
about it, Mary?”&mdash;“I will do whatever
you wish me, replied his Wife&mdash;but
you would do it so much better
yourself. I shall not know what to
say.”&mdash;“My dear Mary, cried he, it is
impossible you can <a href="#n160_17" id="p160_17">be really at a loss</a>.
Nothing can be <a href="#n160_18" id="p160_18">more simple</a>. You
have only to state the present afflicted
situation of the family, their <a href="#n160_20" id="p160_20">earnest</a>
application to me, &amp; my being willing
to promote a little subscription for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>their releif, provided it meet with her
approbation.&mdash;” “The easiest thing
in the World&mdash;cried Miss Diana Parker
who happened to be calling on them
at the moment&mdash;. All said &amp; done, in
less time <a href="#n161_6" id="p161_6">than</a> you have been talking
of it now.&mdash;And while you are on the
subject of subscriptions Mary, I will
thank you to mention a very melancholy
case to Lady D, which has been
represented to me in the most affecting
terms.&mdash;There is a poor Woman in
Worcestershire, whom some friends of
mine are exceedingly interested about,
&amp; I have undertaken to collect whatever
I can for her. If you w<sup>d</sup> mention
the circumstance to Lady Denham!&mdash;Lady
Denham <em>can</em> give, if she is
properly attacked&mdash;&amp; I look upon her
to be <a href="#n161_20" id="p161_20">the sort</a> of Person who, when
once she <a href="#n161_21" id="p161_21">is</a> prevailed on to undraw her
Purse, would as readily give 10<sup>Gs</sup> as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span>5.&mdash;And therefore, if you find her in
a Giving mood, you might as well
speak in favour of another Charity
which I &amp; a few more, have very
much at heart&mdash;the establishment of
a Charitable Repository at Burton on
Trent.&mdash;And <a href="#n162_7" id="p162_7">then</a>,&mdash;there is the family
of the poor Man who was hung last
assizes at York, tho’ we really <em>have</em>
raised the sum we wanted for putting
them <a href="#n162_11" id="p162_11">all out</a>, yet if you <em>can</em> get a
Guinea from her on their behalf, it
may as well be done.&mdash;” “My dear
Diana! exclaimed M<sup>rs</sup> P.&mdash; I could no
more mention these things to Lady
D.&mdash; than I c<sup>d</sup> fly.”&mdash;“Where’s the
difficulty?&mdash;I wish I could go with
you myself&mdash;but in 5 minutes I must
be at M<sup>rs</sup> G.&mdash; to encourage Miss
Lambe in taking her first Dip. She is
so frightened, poor Thing, that I promised
to come &amp; keep up her Spirits,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>&amp; go in the Machine with her if she
wished it&mdash;and as soon as that is <a href="#n163_2" id="p163_2">over</a>,
I must hurry home, for Susan is to
have Leaches <a href="#n163_4" id="p163_4">at one oclock</a>&mdash;which
will be a three hours business,&mdash;therefore
I really have not a moment to
spare&mdash;besides that (<a href="#n163_7" id="p163_7">between</a> ourselves)
I ought to be in bed myself
at this present time, for I am hardly
able to stand&mdash;and when the Leaches
have done, I dare say we shall both
go to our rooms for the rest of the
day.”&mdash;“I am sorry <a href="#n163_13" id="p163_13">to hear it</a>, indeed;
but <a href="#n163_14" id="p163_14">if this is the case</a> I hope Arthur
will come to us.”&mdash;“If Arthur takes
my advice, he will go to bed too, for
if he stays up by himself, he will
certainly eat &amp; drink more than he
ought;&mdash;but you see Mary, how impossible
it is for me to go with you to
Lady Denham’s.”&mdash;“Upon second
thoughts Mary, said her husband, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>will not trouble you to speak about
the Mullins’s.&mdash;I will take an opportunity
of seeing Lady D. myself.&mdash;<em>I</em>
know how little it suits you to be
pressing matters upon a Mind at all
unwilling.”&mdash;<em>His</em> application thus withdrawn,
his sister could say no more in
support of hers, which was his object,
as he felt all <a href="#n164_9" id="p164_9">their impropriety</a> &amp; all
the certainty of their ill effect upon
his own better claim.&mdash;M<sup>rs</sup> P. was
delighted at this release, &amp; set off very
happy with her friend &amp; her little
girl, on this walk to Sanditon House.&mdash;It
was a close, misty morn<sup>g</sup>, &amp; when
they reached the brow of the Hill,
<a href="#n164_17" id="p164_17">they could not</a> for some time make out
what sort of Carriage it was, which
they saw coming <a href="#n164_19" id="p164_19">up</a>. It appeared
at different moments to be everything
from the Gig to the Pheaton,&mdash;from
one horse to 4; &amp; just as they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>concluding in favour of a Tandem,
little Mary’s young eyes distinguished
the Coachman &amp; she eagerly called
out, “T’is Uncle Sidney Mama, it is
indeed.” And so it proved.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> Sidney
Parker driving his Servant in a very
neat Carriage was soon opposite to
them, &amp; they all stopped for a few
minutes. The manners of the Parkers
were always pleasant among themselves&mdash;&amp;
<a href="#n165_11" id="p165_11">it was</a> a very friendly meeting
between Sidney &amp; his sister in law,
who was <a href="#n165_13" id="p165_13">most kindly</a> taking it for
granted that he was on his way to
Trafalgar House. This he declined
however. “He was just come from
Eastbourne, proposing to spend two or
three days, as it might happen, at
Sanditon&mdash;but the Hotel must be his
Quarters&mdash;He was expecting to be
joined there by a friend or two.”&mdash;The
rest was common enquiries &amp;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>remarks, with kind notice of little
Mary, &amp; a very well-bred Bow &amp;
proper address to Miss Heywood on
her being named to him&mdash;and they
parted, to meet again within a few
hours.&mdash;Sidney Parker was about 7 or
8 &amp; 20, very good-looking, <a href="#n166_7" id="p166_7">with a
decided air of Ease &amp; Fashion, and
a</a> lively countenance.&mdash;This adventure
afforded agreable discussion for some
time. M<sup>rs</sup> P. entered into all her
Husband’s joy on the occasion, &amp;
exulted in the credit which Sidney’s
arrival w<sup>d</sup> give to the place. The
<a href="#n166_15a" id="p166_15a">road</a> to Sanditon H. was <a href="#n166_15b" id="p166_15b">a broad</a>,
handsome, planted <a href="#n166_16" id="p166_16">approach</a>, between
fields, <a href="#n166_17" id="p166_17">&amp; conducting at the end of a
q<sup>r</sup> of a mile through second Gates</a>
<a href="#n166_19a" id="p166_19a">into</a> the Grounds, which though <a href="#n166_19b" id="p166_19b">not
extensive</a> <a href="#n166_20" id="p166_20">had</a> all the Beauty &amp; Respectability
which an abundance of
very fine Timber could give.&mdash;<a href="#n166_22" id="p166_22">These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>Entrance Gates were so much in a
corner of the Grounds or Paddock, so
near one of its Boundaries</a>, that <a href="#n167_3" id="p167_3">an
outside</a> fence was at first almost pressing
on the road&mdash;till an angle <a href="#n167_5" id="p167_5"><em>here</em>,
&amp; a curve <em>there</em> threw</a> <a href="#n167_6" id="p167_6">them to</a> a
better distance. The Fence was a
proper Park paling in excellent condition;
with <a href="#n167_9" id="p167_9">clusters of fine Elms, or
rows of old Thorns</a> following its <a href="#n167_10" id="p167_10">line</a>
almost every where.&mdash;<em>Almost</em> must be
stipulated&mdash;for there were <a href="#n167_12" id="p167_12">vacant spaces</a>&mdash;&amp;
through one of these, Charlotte as
soon as they entered the Enclosure,
caught a <a href="#n167_16" id="p167_16">glimpse over the pales</a> of
something White &amp; Womanish in the
field on the other side;&mdash;it was a something
which immediately brought Miss
B. into her head&mdash;&amp; stepping to the
pales, she saw indeed&mdash;&amp; very <a href="#n167_20" id="p167_20">decidedly</a>,
<a href="#n167_21" id="p167_21">in spite of the Mist</a>; Miss <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;</span>
seated, not far before her, at the foot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span>of the <a href="#n168_1" id="p168_1">bank</a> which sloped down from
the outside of the <a href="#n168_2" id="p168_2">Paling &amp;</a> which a
narrow <a href="#n168_3" id="p168_3">Path</a> seemed to skirt along;&mdash;Miss
Brereton seated, apparently very
composedly&mdash;&amp; Sir E. D. by her side.&mdash;They
were sitting so near each other
&amp; appeared so closely engaged in gentle
conversation, that Ch. instantly <a href="#n168_8" id="p168_8">felt</a> she
had nothing to do but to step back
again, &amp; say not a word.&mdash;Privacy
was certainly their object.&mdash;It could
not but <a href="#n168_12" id="p168_12">strike her</a> rather unfavourably
with regard to Clara;&mdash;but hers
was a situation which <a href="#n168_14" id="p168_14">must not</a> be
judged with severity.&mdash;She was glad
to perceive that <a href="#n168_16a" id="p168_16a">nothing had been</a> <a href="#n168_16b" id="p168_16b">discerned</a>
by M<sup>rs</sup> Parker; <a href="#n168_17" id="p168_17">If Charlotte
had not been</a> considerably the tallest of
<a href="#n168_19" id="p168_19">the two</a>, Miss B.’s white ribbons might
not have fallen within the ken of <em>her</em>
more observant eyes.&mdash;Among other
points of moralising reflection which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span>the sight of this Tete a Tete produced,
Charlotte c<sup>d</sup> not but think of the
extreme difficulty which secret Lovers
must have in finding a proper spot for
their stolen Interveiws.&mdash;Here perhaps
they had thought themselves so <a href="#n169_6" id="p169_6">perfectly
secure</a> from observation!&mdash;the
whole field open before them&mdash;a steep
bank &amp; Pales never crossed by the foot
<a href="#n169_10a" id="p169_10a">by Man</a> <a href="#n169_10b" id="p169_10b">at their back</a>&mdash;and a great
thickness of air, in aid.&mdash;Yet here, she
had seen them. They were really <a href="#n169_12" id="p169_12">ill-used</a>.&mdash;The
House was large &amp; handsome;
two Servants appeared, to
admit them, &amp; every thing had a
suitable air of Property &amp; Order.&mdash;Lady
D. valued herself upon her liberal
Establishment, &amp; had great enjoyment
in the <a href="#n169_19" id="p169_19">order and the Importance</a> of her
style of living.&mdash;They were shewn into
the usual sitting room, well-proportioned
&amp; well-furnished;&mdash;tho’ it saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span>Furniture rather originally good &amp;
extremely well kept, than new or
shewey&mdash;and as Lady D. was not
there, Charlotte had leisure to look
about, &amp; to be told by M<sup>rs</sup> P. that the
whole-length Portrait of a <a href="#n170_6" id="p170_6">stately</a>
Gentleman, which placed over the
Mantlepeice, caught the eye immediately,
was the picture of Sir H. Denham&mdash;and
that one among many
Miniatures in another part of the
room, little conspicuous, <a href="#n170_12" id="p170_12">represented</a>
M<sup>r</sup> Hollis.&mdash;Poor M<sup>r</sup> Hollis!&mdash;It was
impossible not to feel him hardly used;
to be obliged to stand back in his <a href="#n170_15" id="p170_15">own
House</a> &amp; see the best place by the fire
constantly occupied by Sir H. D.</p>
